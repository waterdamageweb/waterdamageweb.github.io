Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore security, and cover legs, hands and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Usage soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the moldy area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will lower the incidence of airborne mold spores during cleaning.

Make sure it won't blemish the material or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials used in cleaning in a strong trash can, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a neighboring exit rather than the main house, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>

Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
