<p>Do not presume your homeowners insurance will pay to fix your mold problems. Insurance coverage normally pays if the problem results from an emergency currently covered on your policy, like a burst pipe, however not if mold resulted from postponed upkeep, persistent moisture or seepage, or from floodwaters (unless you have flood insurance coverage). It's important NOT to take a knee jerk reaction if you experience water damage. It's finest to call your insurance company right away. Choosing the restoration company is completely decided by the home owner.<p>
<p>However you might not have the ability to get insurance to spend for your mold remediation costs if the damage is an outcome of your overlook-- for example, if you have actually had a slow leak under your bathroom sink for many years and have ignored the concern.

Your homeowner's insurance coverage likely will not cover the loss if you do not have flood insurance. If the flood has been stated a federal disaster by the President, apply for assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>
