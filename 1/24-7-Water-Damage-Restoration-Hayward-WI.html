When you think a mold intrusion, you may want to invest in a mold screening set to see what kind of mold spores you're dealing with, and contact an expert to aid with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you most likely currently have on-hand) that will help get rid of mold.</p>
<p>Water damage arises from broken pipes, blocked drains, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The proper treatment depends upon the nature of the damage.
