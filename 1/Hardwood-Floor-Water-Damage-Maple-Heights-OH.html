<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Maple Heights</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repairs, remember that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>
