<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is exceptional insurance coverage to have in any scenario, specifically when the hot water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater looms unless fixed quickly, and the costs increase the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>

During a mold evaluation, AdvantaClean's licensed mold specialists, will check, sample and test the air in and around your home for mold detection.

In these cases, our service technicians remove the materials and dispose of them. When we confirm that all the non-salvageable products have been eliminated, we then start the fire restoration and fire cleaning process.</p>
