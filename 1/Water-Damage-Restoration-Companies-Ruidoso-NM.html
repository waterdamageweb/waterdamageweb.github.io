<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Ruidoso</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By lowering the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is essential to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
