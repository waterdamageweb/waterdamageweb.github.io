Before mold lies, you might smell a distinct moldy fragrance or experience allergy symptoms due to mold direct exposure. These odors are specifically pungent in locations like the basement. The nasty odor resembles the aroma of damp, mildewy laundry. Unfortunately, it's not unusual for homeowners to mistake mold development for dirt.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you actually wish to prevent purchasing a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this solution and wipe it straight over mold development. Let the option sit for as much as 10 minutes, and after that scrub the location with a small brush or tooth brush. Clean any remaining mold away with a towel and let the area dry.</p>
