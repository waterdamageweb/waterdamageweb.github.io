<p>Water and bacteria-growth damages can begin within hours. Require expert aid. Mold remediation is the procedure of identifying and removing unhealthy levels of mold that have colonized in a home, office, school or other structure.

In the shorter term, a mold infestation can trigger serious illness.<p>
