Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very respectful person.</p>
