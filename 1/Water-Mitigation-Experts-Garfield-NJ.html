<h3>Fire And Smoke Damage in Garfield</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
