<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly harmful. We engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado as soon as InstaScope was developed. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged specialist on the biological elements of air contamination, this group was appointed to validate and evaluate the new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a new mold-assessment system for industrial consumers that, unlike any other approach or device, can provide scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>

<p>Since it's impossible to eliminate mold in the house totally, it is very important to keep your air clear by frequently replacing air filters. Consider utilizing High Effectiveness Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is usually 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from flowing. You might also consider an air purifier that will eliminate mold spores.

<p>Make certain to keep images of the water damage and all files related to the damage and your claim in the event mold grows in the future. Your insurance company may be reluctant to agree that any potential mold is the result of previous water damage, however having records and pictures will act as important evidence of your claim. If the mold is considered to have actually originated from water damage, some insurance providers may make you submit a 2nd claim of water damage rather, needing you to pay another deductible prior to remediation happens.</p>
<p>After you discover how to remove mold, concentrate on preventing it in the future. Controlling dampness is the crucial to stopping most mold. The worst infestations normally occur in moist crawl spaces, attics, walls where water leaked in from the outside, and in basements with bad foundation drainage.
