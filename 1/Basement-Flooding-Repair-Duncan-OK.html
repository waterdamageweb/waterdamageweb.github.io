<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
