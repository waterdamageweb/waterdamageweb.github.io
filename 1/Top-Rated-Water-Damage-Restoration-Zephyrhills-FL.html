Black mold, specifically, however, is a more serious transgressor. Exposure to the poisonous range of Stachybotrys chartarum can trigger breathing problems varying from moderate to severe. It, like many type of mold, grows at a disconcerting rate in the best conditions-- namely in locations with prolonged direct exposure to moisture and humidity, such as basements, restrooms, under-sink cabinets, or just recently flooded areas.
