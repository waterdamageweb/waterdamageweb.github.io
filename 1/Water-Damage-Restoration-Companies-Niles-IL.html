<p>Many molds prosper at regular indoor temperature levels; few if any molds are able to grow listed below 40 F or above 100 F. Outside this range molds may stay inactive or dormant; they might begin to grow again when the temperature is more beneficial. Temperature levels well above 100 F will kill mold and mold spores, but the specific temperature needed to eliminate specific species is not well developed.<p>
<p>The most significant element that can be removed is the moisture that mold requires to cultivate. There are over 100,000 kinds of types of mold, however the most typical kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days.
