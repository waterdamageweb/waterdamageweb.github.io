<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days.

If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and need to be eliminated.

This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
