<h3>Fire And Restoration in Weston</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
