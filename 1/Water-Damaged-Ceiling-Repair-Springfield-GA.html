<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
