They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
