If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really costly paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>
