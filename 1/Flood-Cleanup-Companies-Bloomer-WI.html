<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
