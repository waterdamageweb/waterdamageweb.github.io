<p>Lastly, we want to deal with the use of bleach on mold.

First, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical level of sensitivities particularly if utilized in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach disappears effective at removing mold than a moderate detergent and a wet fabric, so we advise the least hazardous alternative.</p>
<p>Often water streams unseen down the within wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall. Unless water discolorations appear, this wetness might go undetected till molds and smell problems take place.
