<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up.

This process soaks up wetness without ice build-up and is not restricted by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily run below freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition.

<p>Clean it: Mold is remediated using antimicrobial and biocide representatives that are sprayed to inactivate or eliminate any bacteria. Porous products like ceiling tiles, insulation drywall and material are normally removed. Semi-Porous non-Removable materials like wood and concrete can be cleaned with HEPA vacuum, abrasive sanding and hand cleaning. Our professionals will then press clean all affected semi-porous and non-porous structure materials, such as tile, wood, and cement. Then, they will apply bactericide in order to neutralize germs and other impurities. Finally, service technicians will force-dry the location using commercial structural drying equipment.<p>
<p>Wait on your components to dry. Isopropyl alcohol will take a little while to totally dry, so leave all of your components out for at least 4 hours before reassembling the iPhone. Our professionals then complete a thorough inspection to explore the level of the issue, and the issues that triggered mold to grow in the very first location. Our experts know exactly what to try to find, sometimes they discover that residents simply switched off the a/c without opening any windows, which develops a high level of humidity in the interior environment.<p>
