<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health danger and should be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
