<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.</p>
