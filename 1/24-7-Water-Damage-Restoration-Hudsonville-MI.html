<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a costs for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
