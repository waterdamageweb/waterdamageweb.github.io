Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might need fixing, if there is small damage.

With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for specific planks.
