<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show visible signs of moisture, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may fall apart or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous gypsum material. Other times, you may see small indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand gradually.</p>
<p>After storms and other weather-related catastrophes, homeowners frequently find themselves besieged by undependable, unprofessional repair services. To avoid that problem, try to find reliable water damage restoration companies with excellent recommendations from local customers such as your good friends and next-door neighbors.

<p>After you find out how to eliminate mold, concentrate on preventing it in the future. Controlling dampness is the key to stopping most mold. The worst infestations usually happen in damp crawl spaces, attics, walls where water leaked in from the outdoors, and in basements with poor foundation drain. Stopping leakages, ensuring great ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water far from the foundation are the very best defenses versus mold.</p>

<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health threat and need to be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
