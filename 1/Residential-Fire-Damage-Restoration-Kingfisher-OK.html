<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling because of a leaky roofing system, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and stress, especially if you have actually never ever done it previously. Mold needs just three things to grow and survive: humidity, moisture and darkness. The most common locations in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, ducts, crawlspaces and carpets. The very best way to prevent mold development is to get rid of water leaks or wetness in your home. See our short article, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold prevention suggestions.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice sufficient kitchen maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Wipe water from difficult surfaces, and fix leaky faucets as soon as possible. Always make sure your tableware and serving dishes are dry prior to storing them to keep mold from proliferating in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make certain to dry the area to avoid it from spreading out.</p>
