<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and need to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
