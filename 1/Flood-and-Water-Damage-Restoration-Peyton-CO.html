<p>Even when you consist of a small indoor fire, smoke damage can happen. That's since fire is a visible combustion of light and heat, and many people understand how to consist of a fire. For that reason, individuals will work to include a fire without prioritizing smoke damage prevention. Smoke is slightly harder to see than the fire itself and appears less threatening.
