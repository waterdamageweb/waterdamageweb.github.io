<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

If it sits for too long, there's a chance that more damage will occur or a Category 1 water damage will become a Category 2, which can have impacts on your health.
