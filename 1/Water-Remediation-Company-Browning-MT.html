<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can purchase gadgets to determine relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air flow near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to lessen the production of moisture in the home are all really essential in managing high humidity that often causes mold development in our environment.</p>

<p>A Wisconsin home in SE Wisconsin experienced a cooking area fire when a grease fire began on the stove. The owner used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire but after smoke and soot took a trip throughout the house of this two-story home it was impacted in numerous ways. Even the attic insulation had soot on it that required everything to be eliminated. Water and sewage need to be extracted, and the impacted areas professionally cleaned up, aerated, dried and decontaminated as rapidly as possible to lower bacteria, mold. and other harmful microbe growth, which can cause extra damage to the residential or commercial property on top of water damage and create possible health dangers for your household or employees.<p>
<p>Our local Doral location SERVPRO has the training and competence to provide options for your business or residential property damage cleanup, restoration or repair needs. Our SERVPRO professionals can restore and repair your residential or commercial property following a water smoke, damage and fire damage, mold damage, or flood and storm damage event. Once your surface is dry and strong, apply a filler to make the surface smooth and ready for painting. Normally, you must offer this step at least a complete day of drying time. We kind of cheated in the video above by using a hair dryer to speed up the procedure, but finest practice here is one-day drying time.<p>
