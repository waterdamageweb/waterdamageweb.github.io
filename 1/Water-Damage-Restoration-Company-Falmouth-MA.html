<h3>Fire Restoration in Falmouth - Fix Your Smoke and Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By decreasing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is finished.<p>
