<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The most important element of fixing drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew occur most frequently. No matter the location or extent of the damage, we recommend utilizing dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar devices that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Standard household fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air needed to dry a room properly.</p>
