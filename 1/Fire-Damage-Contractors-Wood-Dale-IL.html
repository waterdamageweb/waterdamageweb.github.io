<p>When you are planning large repairs, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges.
