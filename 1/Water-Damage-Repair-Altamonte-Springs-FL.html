Likewise, high humidity levels such as condensation on glass and metal surfaces are an indication of mold.</p>
<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any adjustments if you have concerns on this.</p>
