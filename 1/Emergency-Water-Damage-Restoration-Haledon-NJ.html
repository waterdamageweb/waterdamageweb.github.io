<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Haledon - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health risk and need to be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
