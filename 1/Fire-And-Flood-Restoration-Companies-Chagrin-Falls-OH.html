<p>Generally, indoor air levels of Stachybotrys are low. As with other types of mold, at higher levels negative health effects may occur. These include cold-like symptoms, rashes, sinus swelling, eye inflammation and aggravation of asthma. Some signs are more general - such as failure to concentrate or fatigue. Normally, symptoms vanish after the mold is removed. Mitigation is thought about an emergency service. Water has the damaging tendency to cause prevalent damage to materials that absorb it. As a result, water mitigators realize the importance of a quick response. In basic, the time it requires to mitigate a residential or commercial property depends upon how serious the water damage is.<p>
