<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can provide your living room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, however a weathered and cracked chimney can typically allow rain during the chillier months which can permeate through the walls. Gradually, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into a worn out and unloved space.<p>
<p>When dealing with wet drywall, keep in mind to use security goggles and masks. If you're dealing with a basement flood circumstance, utilize a laser level or other device to mark 6 inches above the waterline around the space. If you are repairing a little area, mark a square or rectangle around the water damaged area to eliminate. Put down a tarpaulin to capture dust and particles.
