Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve.
