<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Abita Springs</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is ended up.<p>
