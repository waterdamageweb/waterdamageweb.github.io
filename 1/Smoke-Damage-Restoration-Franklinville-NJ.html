<p>While the iPhone 7 and later on are water-resistant, it doesn't stop water from entering the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later on have a comparable problem, although they feature a built-in feature that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a specific frequency. The worst issue with mold is that it has the potential to trigger health impacts. Mold can trigger allergies and even asthma attacks, as some people are allergic to mold. As mold requires water to grow it is necessary to avoid wetness and humidity issues in structures, particularly ones impacted by water.<p>
