Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve.
