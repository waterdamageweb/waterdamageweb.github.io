<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and good, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Mold remediation ought to not simply eliminate a current growth, but also ensure mold doesn't find a method to come back.

The anti-microbial is non-toxic and water-based, so you don't need to have any stress over leaching, VOC emissions or other environmental or irritant concerns. We go into more detail about our prevention methods below. At Mold Solutions NW, we don't simply wish to eliminate mold - we don't desire it to ever grow back.</p>
