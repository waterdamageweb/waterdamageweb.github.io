<p>If the wet iPhone remains in a case, remove it; take the SIM card out too.

These actions assist to lower the variety of crannies and nooks where water can linger, and avoid damage to parts. Next, scrub the location to get rid of all of the mold and mold discolorations. And lastly, wipe the surface to get rid of residual mold and spores.<p>
<p>Open all windows in the space to assist with the drying process. If there are cabinets in the room, they should be exposed, too. Prevent shutting the door to the impacted location given that you don't wish to promote mold growth. When it is wet enough to damage your device, the water damage sign is a little white tab which turns red. If this has reddened, it is likely that your phone has an issue.<p>

<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it could inadvertently push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. If the phone was completely immersed, you might attempt vacuuming around the phone's cracks and openings to suck more water out. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is imperative to prevent recontamination. You need to seal and immediately get rid of materials that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the boots or shoes you wore while cleaning, clean your clothes in hot water, and shower to remove spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
