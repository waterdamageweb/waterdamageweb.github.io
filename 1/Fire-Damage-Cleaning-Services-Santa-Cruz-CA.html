<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
