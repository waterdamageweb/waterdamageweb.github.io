Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
