<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you understand how much brand-new wallboard you need. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a spot to fit, utilizing an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and then secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel satisfies. Then apply joint compound over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the manufacturer and after that sand the compound with fine-grit sandpaper up until the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
