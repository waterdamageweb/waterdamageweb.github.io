<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow.
