<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, however it can occur on its own if a fire is included. Several hundred suits filed in the last five years declare that most of these houses contain lots of offenses of the state-mandated building regulations that eventually allowed water to drain into both new and remodelled homes. Numerous houses with water damage lack standard weatherproofing materials, inspection reports say. Coats of stucco are frequently too thin. According to a lawsuit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, craftsmanship was so poor that, even prior to the household relocated, a mushroom grew in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bedroom.</p>

Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can cause wetness on the underside of the roofing system, which can cause mold and decaying.
