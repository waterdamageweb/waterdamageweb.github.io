<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job appropriately.
