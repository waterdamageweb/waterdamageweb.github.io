<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable signs of wetness, dripping water, or signs of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might fall apart or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you may see little signs like coffee-colored stains that may expand over time.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
