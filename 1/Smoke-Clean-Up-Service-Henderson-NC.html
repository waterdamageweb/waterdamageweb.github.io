<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The most crucial element of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew occur most frequently when damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation. No matter the place or extent of the damage, we encourage utilizing dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or comparable makers that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Standard household fans are not efficient in moving an adequate amount of air required to dry a room properly.</p>

<p>Sadly, however, using bleach is just efficient if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, bathtubs, glass and counter tops. Bleach can not penetrate into porous materials therefore it does not come into contact with mold growing beneath the surface area of products such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these products will eliminate the mold above the surface area however the roots within the material will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
