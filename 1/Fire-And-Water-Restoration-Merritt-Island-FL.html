Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold development should be prevented. Mold replicate by means of small spores. The spores are like seeds, but unnoticeable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature, wetness, and readily available nutrient conditions are appropriate, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are transferred. 1 There are numerous types of mold, but all require wetness and a food source for development.</p>
