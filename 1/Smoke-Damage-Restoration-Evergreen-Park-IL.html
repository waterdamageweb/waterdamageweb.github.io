<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that wipe it away with a damp towel. As with a few of the above methods, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working all right. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. When mixed with ammonia, chlorine bleach likewise gives off severe fumes and it even produces poisonous gas. There are more secure alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce unsafe fumes or leave behind hazardous residue. For these reasons try to avoid using bleach and if you need to utilize it, only use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
