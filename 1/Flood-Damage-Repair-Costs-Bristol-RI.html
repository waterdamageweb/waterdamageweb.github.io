As soon as MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements.

If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very costly paperweight.</p>
