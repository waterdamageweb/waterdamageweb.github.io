<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of home damage that a family or organisation can experience. Once MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
