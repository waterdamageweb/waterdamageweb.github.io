<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
