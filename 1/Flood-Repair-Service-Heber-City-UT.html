<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. An automatic shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any situation, especially when the water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater impends unless repaired rapidly, and the costs increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache because the plaster drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply starts to droop before drying out, fixing it might simply require pushing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
