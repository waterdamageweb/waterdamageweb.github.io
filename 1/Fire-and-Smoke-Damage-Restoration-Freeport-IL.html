<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most terrible things that can take place to a household or a person. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being completely replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard may need fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might need replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The type of wood flooring you might have identifies and limits the type of repair work that require to happen. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a broader range of options to repair the issue. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for specific planks. The best way to look after a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>

<p>HEATING AND COOLING: Heating unit and air conditioner systems can become flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot lights. They can also become muddy, and cleaning them will need professional cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and end up being infected.

<p>Since mold and mildew can be a major health hazard, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
