<p>The cost of electrical use for our equipment is typically less than people think. Simply the same, it is frequently an expense that is picked up by your insurance coverage carrier, if your policy enables it.

<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying task back days.

These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
