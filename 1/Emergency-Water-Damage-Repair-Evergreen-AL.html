If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really costly paperweight.</p>
