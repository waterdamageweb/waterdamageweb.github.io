<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in Berea</h3>
<p>Before you clean your home, you need to wear appropriate defense. Soot, debris and smoke can be dangerous to breathe in, so wear a respirator if there is significant soot in the damaged area. Wear long sleeves and trousers to protect your skin. You should also use gloves and eye defense. Given that you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is necessary to lay down floor protection and eliminate any furniture or home objects that are not damaged. If the damaged location is small, you can most likely get away with merely covering furniture with plastic or sheets. However if you're cleaning an entire room, it's wise to get rid of those clean items and even seal off other rooms that are intact. Be mindful of the shoes you're using so you do not track soot stains into other rooms.<p>
