Water damaged walls frequently peel and may need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs a number of hours.<p>
<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall products typically do not dry extremely well, so if your walls are soaked, it's typically best to rip them out to prevent mold, specifically if they aren't completely dry within 2 days.
