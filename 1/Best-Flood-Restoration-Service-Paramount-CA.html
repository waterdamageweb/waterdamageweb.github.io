<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely devastating. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
