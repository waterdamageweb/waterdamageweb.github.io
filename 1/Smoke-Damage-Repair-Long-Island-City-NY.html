<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Long Island City</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health danger and need to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>A moisture probe, a tool of the trade, can get behind stucco and other exteriors to determine the portion of water in the walls.
