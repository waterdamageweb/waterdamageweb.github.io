Basically, it makes the area solid again and safeguards the surface area from future water damage. After you have actually applied the Peel-Stop, permit an hour of drying time.<p>

<p>A bleach service also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface area and don't rinse.
