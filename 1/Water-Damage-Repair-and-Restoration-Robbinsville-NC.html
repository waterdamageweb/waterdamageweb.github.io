<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments if you have concerns on this.</p>
<p>First things first - prepare what you need Basically, you require a reliable product in cleaning mold. Many household owners think that bleach is a reliable mold treatment.

Since you will be cleaning mold with water, the surface will be wet for an amount of time. Goal to accelerate the drying process by aerating the location. Open doors and windows if possible and run a dehumidifier. You can also use air movers to quickly dry the surface area.<p>
