<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
