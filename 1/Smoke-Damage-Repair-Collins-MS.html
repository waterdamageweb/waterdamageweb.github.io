<h3>Fire And Smoke Restoration in Collins</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health threat and need to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
