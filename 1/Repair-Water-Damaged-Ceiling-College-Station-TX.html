These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout several days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
