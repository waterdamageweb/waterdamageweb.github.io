<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The most important element of treating drywall water damage is to prevent additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew occur most often when damp drywall sits with insufficient ventilation.

Standard home fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient amount of air needed to dry a room sufficiently.</p>
