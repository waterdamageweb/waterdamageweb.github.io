<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you require a desiccant. Many individuals swear by raw rice, advising owners to put their wet iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the things (cover it completely) and leave it there for two days or so. A: Mold is a tiny fungus that becomes part of the natural surroundings and essential for our ecosystem. While it is essential in the outdoor world, too much mold inside a structure can be unsafe and unhygienic. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores drift through the air both inside and outside.<p>
<p>Eliminating one of the 3 requirements for mold reduces (or eliminates) new mold development: wetness; food for the mold spores (for example, dust or dander ); and warmth since mold generally does not grow in cold environments. I had a fantastic experience dealing with the group at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were expert, very communicative and prompt! I would absolutely advise for any mitigation or restoration work you require.<p>
