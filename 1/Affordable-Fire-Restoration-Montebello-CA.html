<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and steady degeneration of products (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you combine electrical energy, oxygen, metal and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no dependable timetable for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal parts generally start rusting right away after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of an issue. How quick the corrosion process takes depends on a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust caused by a water spill.</p>
