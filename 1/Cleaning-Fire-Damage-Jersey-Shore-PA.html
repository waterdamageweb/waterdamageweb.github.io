The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type.

These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
