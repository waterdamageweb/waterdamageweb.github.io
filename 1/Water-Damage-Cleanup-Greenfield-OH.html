<p>Crawl areas typically grow mold for the very same reasons as basements do-they tend to remain damp long-lasting. They're smaller than basements, however, and normally have more ventilation, so they don't tend to have as big a mold growth area, making common costs closer to $500 for remediation.

<p>Using bleach or other chemicals to kill indoor mold development is not required for the most part. The goal should be to get rid of mold development by cleaning or getting rid of musty products. Dead mold can still position health risks if you are exposed. Using bleach or other disinfectants on surfaces after mold removal might be needed where people are thought to be vulnerable to fungal infections (such as a person with immune system issues).

<p>Last but not least, we want to address using bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical sensitivities particularly if used in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach disappears efficient at eliminating mold than a mild detergent and a damp cloth, so we suggest the least toxic choice.</p>
