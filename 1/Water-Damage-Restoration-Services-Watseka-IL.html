They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were really delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.
