The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout several days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
