<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or issues with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Use a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore protection, and cover arms, legs and hands to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold. If the moldy location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will decrease the occurrence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the musty locations, in addition to any surrounding locations. Make sure it will not blemish the material or surface if you use bleach. Place all sponges, devices and other products used in cleaning in a strong trash can, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a neighboring exit as opposed to the main house, to avoid dispersing mold spores.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any hard surfaces to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be removed, such as furnishings, clothes, or toys, these are usually brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are gotten rid of, normally involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
