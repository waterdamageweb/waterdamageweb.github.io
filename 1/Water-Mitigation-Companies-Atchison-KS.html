<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
