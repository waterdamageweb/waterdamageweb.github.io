These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
