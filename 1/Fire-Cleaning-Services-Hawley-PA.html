Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
