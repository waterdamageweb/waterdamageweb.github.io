<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
