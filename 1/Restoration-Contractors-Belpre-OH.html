<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health danger, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
