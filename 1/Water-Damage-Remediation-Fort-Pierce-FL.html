Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a vital part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside your home, mold development should be prevented. Mold reproduce by ways of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but undetectable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces.

On the other hand, SERVPRO of North Orange County and SERVPRO of South Orange County can access resources from 1,700 Franchises throughout the state and nation and even utilize Disaster Recovery Groups for major storms and disasters. Desiccants are commonly utilized to dry thick products (lath, hardwood and plaster walls, concrete, and so on) due to the big vapor pressure differentials they develop between the surface and air.

<p>Eliminating one of the three requirements for mold decreases (or eliminates) new mold development: wetness; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and warmth considering that mold normally does not grow in cold environments.
