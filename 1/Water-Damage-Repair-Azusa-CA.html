A pipe burst in the attic can cause gallons of water drizzling down on the spaces inside your home.</p>
<p>Crawl areas frequently grow mold for the exact same reasons as basements do-they tend to remain damp long-lasting. They're smaller sized than basements, however, and usually have more ventilation, so they don't tend to have as big a mold development area, making common expenses better to $500 for remediation.
