<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>It just takes a little water leak, or even excess humidity, for mold to form in your Cedar Falls home or business. Then, mold can spread rapidly through the home in as low as two days.

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every two to three spaces, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days.
