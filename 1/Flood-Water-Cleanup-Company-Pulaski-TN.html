<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a household or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>
