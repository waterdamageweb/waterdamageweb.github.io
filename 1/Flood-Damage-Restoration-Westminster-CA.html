It may be covered by insurance coverage when a product currently covered under your homeowners insurance coverage breaks accidentally-- for example, if your pipes all of a sudden ruptures and water floods your house, the homeowners insurance will cover part or all of the expenses for the plumbing repair and any mold remediation costs necessary as a direct result of the water damage.<p>
