<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. We engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was developed. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged expert on the biological elements of air contamination, this team was assigned to validate and test the new innovation. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial customers that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can provide scientifically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so instantly.

<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's utilized on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical.

For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you must utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
