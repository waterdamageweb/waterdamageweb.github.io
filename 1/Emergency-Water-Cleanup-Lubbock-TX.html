<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall materials normally don't dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's usually best to rip them out to avoid mold, particularly if they aren't totally dry within two days.

<p>Mold - the appearance, the odor, even the idea of it makes you recoil. You most likely have visions of long-forgotten takeout food packed in the back of your refrigerator, or an old decrepit bath tub that hasn't been used in years.
