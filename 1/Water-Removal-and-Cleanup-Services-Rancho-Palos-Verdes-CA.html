<p>Given that it's impossible to eliminate mold in your house entirely, it is very important to keep your air clear by frequently changing air filters.

You may also think about an air cleanser that will remove mold spores. If you reside in a particularly moist environment, discover one with an antimicrobial filter to ensure that the filter itself stays free from mold.</p>
