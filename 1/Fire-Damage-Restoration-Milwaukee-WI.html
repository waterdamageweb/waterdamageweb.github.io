<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over afflicted location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that clean it away with a wet towel. As with some of the above techniques, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any hard surfaces to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be removed, such as furnishings, clothing, or toys, these are generally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eliminated, usually involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
