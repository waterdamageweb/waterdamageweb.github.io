<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite individual.</p>
