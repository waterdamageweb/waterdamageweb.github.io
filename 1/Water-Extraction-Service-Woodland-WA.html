Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage started, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very polite person.</p>
