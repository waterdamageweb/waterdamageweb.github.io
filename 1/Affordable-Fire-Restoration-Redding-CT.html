<p>The cost of electrical usage for our devices is normally less than individuals think. Simply the same, it is typically an expense that is picked up by your insurance provider, if your policy permits it. We have a calculator that calculates the extra electrical expense from our equipment, based upon the maximum amp draw of each piece of equipment increased by the number of days we had it running. We can submit that to your insurance company upon request, or your insurance coverage adjuster may ask you for a copy of your electrical expense to review. Typically it is in between $25-$ 75.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
