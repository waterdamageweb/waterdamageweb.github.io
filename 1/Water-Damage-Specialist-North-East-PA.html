<p>Because typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
