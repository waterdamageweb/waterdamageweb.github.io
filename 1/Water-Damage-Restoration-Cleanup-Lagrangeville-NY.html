Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying since the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
