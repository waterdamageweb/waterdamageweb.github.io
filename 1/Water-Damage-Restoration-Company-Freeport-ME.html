<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any modifications.</p>
