<p>As wetness is launched in the air, nature constantly tries to reach stability. Calculating the dew point is essential in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point constantly happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type.

<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Marcy</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and must be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
