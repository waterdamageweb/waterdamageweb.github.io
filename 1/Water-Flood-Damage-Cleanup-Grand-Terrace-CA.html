<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As mentioned, rapid air motion across wet surface areas of assemblies or materials is a critical element of successfully and effectively drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface vary from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies. Fast air motion across the surface of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface moisture paves the way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for altering conditions.</p>
