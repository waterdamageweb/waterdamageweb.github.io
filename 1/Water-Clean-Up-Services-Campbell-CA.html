<h3>Drywall Water Damage Repair in Campbell California</h2>
<p>We just recently had major water damage due to a cleaning device overflow. Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action required to avoid additional damage working late into the night. They also completed the whole dry out which took several days and a lot of hard work. Constantly shown up on time and did what they guaranteed and kept me informed of each action. It was a satisfaction to deal with the whole group. I would not be reluctant to suggest them for any work of this nature consisting of mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>Advanced Structural Drying (ASD), based on psychrometry, science, and mathematical formulas, is a proven approach to accelerate drying, lowering costs, time, and hassle related to replacement and repair work.

<p>Often water flows unseen down the within wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall. Unless water discolorations appear, this wetness might go undetected until molds and smell problems happen.
