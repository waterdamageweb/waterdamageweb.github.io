<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Boise</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health hazard and need to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

<p>Mold Containment. The source of the moisture issue is resolved and the affected area is shut off to avoid infecting the rest of your home with mold spores stirred up during the removal process.
