<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance coverage to have in any scenario, particularly when the hot water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater looms unless repaired rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>An insurance policy might or may not cover the costs connected with water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a typical reason for residential water damage is typically the failure of a sump pump, lots of house owner's insurance policies do not cover the associated expenses without an addendum which contributes to the regular monthly premium of the policy. Often the verbiage of this addendum resembles "Sewer and Drain Protection".</p>
