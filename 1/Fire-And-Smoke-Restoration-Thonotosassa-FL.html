<p>Since mold and mildew can be a major health risk, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets.
