<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Generally, indoor air levels of Stachybotrys are low. Just like other kinds of mold, at greater levels negative health impacts may happen. These include cold-like signs, rashes, sinus swelling, eye inflammation and irritation of asthma. Some signs are more basic - such as failure to concentrate or fatigue. Usually, symptoms disappear after the mold is eliminated. Mitigation is considered an emergency service. Water has the harmful tendency to cause prevalent damage to materials that absorb it.
