<p>The cost of electrical use for our devices is typically less than individuals believe. Simply the same, it is frequently a cost that is picked up by your insurance carrier, if your policy permits it. We have a calculator that calculates the extra electrical cost from our equipment, based on the optimum amp draw of each piece of equipment multiplied by the variety of days we had it running. We can submit that to your insurance provider upon request, or your insurance coverage adjuster may ask you for a copy of your electrical expense to examine. Typically it is between $25-$ 75.</p>
<p>Material Removal: Some products will need to be removed prior to the start of the cleaning procedure. Frequently, walls, cabinets, and ceilings near the source of the fire are beyond conserving. In these cases, our professionals eliminate the materials and dispose of them. Once we verify that all the non-salvageable materials have been gotten rid of, we then begin the fire restoration and fire cleaning procedure.</p>
