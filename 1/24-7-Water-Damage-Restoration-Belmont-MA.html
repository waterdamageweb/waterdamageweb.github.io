Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
