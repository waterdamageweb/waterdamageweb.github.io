Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
