<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences.

Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>

<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the gradual and sluggish degeneration of materials (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust occurs when you combine electrical energy, water, oxygen and metal, developing iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no trusted schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal elements typically start rusting instantly after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can work generally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How quickly the deterioration process takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion triggered by a water spill.</p>
