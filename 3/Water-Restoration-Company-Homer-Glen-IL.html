<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
