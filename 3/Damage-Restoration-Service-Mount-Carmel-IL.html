Did you understand that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a broad area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
