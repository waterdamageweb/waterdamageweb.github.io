<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most devastating things that can happen to a family or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired instead of being totally replaced.

The kind of wood flooring you might have identifies and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Solid hardwood floor covering permits a larger range of choices to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area. This type of flooring can also have replacements for specific planks. The very best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
