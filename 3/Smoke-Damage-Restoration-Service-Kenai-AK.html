<h3>Importance of Hiring Fire Damage Cleanup Specialist in Kenai</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is completed.<p>
