<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a harmful situation for homeowners, according to Plumbing 2.0's experienced plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and lack of sanitation up until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewage system can not function properly (typical plumbing problems in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater count on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to decrease the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (infections, germs and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those hazardous products can get in the groundwater and your drinking water system.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a serious health hazard, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of as much as 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
