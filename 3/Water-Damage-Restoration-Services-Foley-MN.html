<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold remediation ought to not just kill an existing growth, however also make sure mold doesn't discover a method to come back. Our 10-year warranty promises that the EPA-registered anti-microbial we utilize will keep mold from growing back after it is removed.
