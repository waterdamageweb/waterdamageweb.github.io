<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and slow deterioration of materials (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you combine electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more frequently known as rust). There is no reputable schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal parts normally start corroding right away after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of a problem. How fast the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
