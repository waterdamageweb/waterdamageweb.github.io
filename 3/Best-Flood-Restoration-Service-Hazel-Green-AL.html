<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
