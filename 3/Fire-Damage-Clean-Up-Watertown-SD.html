Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
