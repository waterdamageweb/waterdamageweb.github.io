<p>There are 2 ways in which water gets in a building as an outcome of windstorm damage. The very first involves falling or windblown rainwater that goes into because of damage to roof components or wall assemblies.

This ground-surface water (storm surge) might build up to a depth of several inches or a number of feet. Far more intricate procedures generally are required when structures are partially submerged or stay considerably flooded for weeks</p>
