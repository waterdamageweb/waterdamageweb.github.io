<p>Since common building products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
