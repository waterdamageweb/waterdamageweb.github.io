<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and beneficial temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also derive nutrients from some artificial items such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs wetness, although some mold species can acquire that wetness from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Thoroughly pry baseboards away from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can rapidly take in flood water, and you need to understand the degree of prospective damage.<p>
