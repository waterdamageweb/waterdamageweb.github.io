<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most devastating things that can occur to a household or a person. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed instead of being totally replaced. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require repairing.

With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This type of flooring can also have replacements for specific slabs. The very best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
