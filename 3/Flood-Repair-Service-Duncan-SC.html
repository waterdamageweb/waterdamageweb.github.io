Other times, your deductible might be deducted" from the final insurance check, in which case you would pay the deductible quantity at the end of the project. Another possibility is that your insurance provider take the deductible quantity off of the quantity they owe you for your personal contents. In all these cases, you ultimately pay your deductible, either to Flagship or in another way.</p>

<p>Jake (and his team) are incredible to work with. They fasted to react at first and supplied a reasonable and fair quote. They had the ability to fit us into their schedule immediately and get the work done extremely rapidly. Our mold problem wound up being smaller sized than first thought so the last billing showed the actual work needed and was less than first estimated. Jake was extremely responsive to calls and emails answering concerns throughout the procedure. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>Recent Review: A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water build-up. Colby and Caleb showed up on the scene within a couple of hours and proceeded to drain pipes the area before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed new insulation in the area. They offered outstanding, efficient, and professional service in addition to being pleasant and friendly to deal with. I wholeheartedly recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again ought to the need occur.</p>
