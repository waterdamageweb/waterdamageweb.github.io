<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the beginning point for lots of serious problems that can impact a structure, damage personal property and present serious health dangers to occupants.

In addition, they need to be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurance provider agents with confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the best breeding place for mold, while poor indoor ventilation can trigger molds to thrive. Wet building materials and damp indoor air are mold's best friends.</p>
