<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a household or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
