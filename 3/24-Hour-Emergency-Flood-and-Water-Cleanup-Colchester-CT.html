Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become contaminated with molds.

When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
