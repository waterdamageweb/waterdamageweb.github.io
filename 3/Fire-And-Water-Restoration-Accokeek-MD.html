<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
