<p>Last but not least, we want to attend to the use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold growth is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities specifically if utilized in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at getting rid of mold than a mild detergent and a wet fabric, so we recommend the least toxic option.</p>
<p>Most mold problems begin small, and might go undetected if they are inside a crawl space, duct, or other inconspicuous location.
