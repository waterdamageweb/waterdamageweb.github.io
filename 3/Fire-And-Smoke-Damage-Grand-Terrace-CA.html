<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a moist towel. Similar to some of the above approaches, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
