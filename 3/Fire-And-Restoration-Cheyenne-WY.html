<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
