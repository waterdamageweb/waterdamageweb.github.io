<h3>Water Damage Drying in Brockton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The location that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily take a trip once they are interrupted. Air purification systems are typically used in conjunction with the sealing of the area to remove as many airborne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the location includes using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with unfavorable atmospheric pressure, which avoids the circulation of air between the contaminated space and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading out too.</p>
<p>We follow a stringent procedure stated by the IICRC (Institute of Inspection Cleaning, Restoration and Certification) S500 Requirement and Referral Guide for Professional Water Damage Restoration. EnviroShield has been dealing with Insurer for over twenty years completing all aspects of water damage dry outs and restoration. We are unique since we also are a Mold Remediation Company.</p>
