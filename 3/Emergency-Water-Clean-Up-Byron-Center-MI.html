<p>Water damage develops from broken pipes, obstructed drains, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends on the nature of the damage.

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
