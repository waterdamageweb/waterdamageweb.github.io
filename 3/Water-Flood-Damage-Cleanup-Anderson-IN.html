<p>Inspect damaged materials for mold and mildew Mold can begin to grow in the best conditions in as low as 24 hours. For long-lasting issues, like mold triggered by attic condensation, the mold might have begun growing a very long time earlier.

And keep in mind that mold can show up in concealed locations like within walls or under floorings, so this evaluation and water damage repair will be continuous.</p>
