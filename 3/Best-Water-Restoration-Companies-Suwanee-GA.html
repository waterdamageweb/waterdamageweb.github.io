<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and very respectful person.</p>
