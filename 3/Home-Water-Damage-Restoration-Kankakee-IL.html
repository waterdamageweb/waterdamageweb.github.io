<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become contaminated with molds.

When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
