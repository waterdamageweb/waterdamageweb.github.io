<p>After you've cleaned up adequately, dry the surface areas with a clean rag. You may use fans to speed this procedure up. You probably still smell smoke smells, which can take a couple of days to a couple of weeks to dissipate. Take a look around the room, and determine materials that can quickly absorb smell. You can put these items together in a different space or outdoors to see if the odor dissipates after a couple of days; consider throwing out the items you can stand to part with. Getting your carpets professionally steam-cleamed can also aid with lingering smoke smells - same goes with any upholstery, furnishings or drapes.

Hyphae or roots begin to become the food source and mycotoxins or dangerous gasses are released as the fungis spreads. Mold in your house can be extremely unsafe and cause a range of health concerns. Making efficient mold remediation more costly and difficult if the mold in your home is not eliminated correctly it can continue to grow.<p>
