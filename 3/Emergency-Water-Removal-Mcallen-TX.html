<h3>Flood Water Damage Repair in Mcallen Texas</h2>
<p>We recently had significant water damage due to a washing maker overflow. Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action required to avoid additional damage working late into the night. They also finished the whole dry which took numerous days and a lot of hard work. Always arrived on time and did what they promised and kept me notified of each action. It was an enjoyment to deal with the entire group. I would not think twice to advise them for any work of this nature including mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a serious health hazard, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove as much as 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Depending on the intensity of your drywall water damage, it may not be needed to change your drywall after a flood or leakage. In the extent of the severe damage or damage covering a large area of a wall or ceiling, call an expert for aid as there may be structural damage to your home.
