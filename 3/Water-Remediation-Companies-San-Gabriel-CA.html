<h3>Local Flood Cleanup in San Gabriel California</h2>
<p>Mold in the basement can be relentless, given the nature of basements - they tend to be far more humid than above-ground levels and normally have poor ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can trigger mold to flourish. And of course, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to severe weather or undiscovered leakages in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, once mold develops, concrete block or concrete walls can be hard to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to address using bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical sensitivities particularly if used in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at removing mold than a wet fabric and a mild cleaning agent, so we recommend the least harmful option.</p>

Drying fans were set up, heating pads were put on hardwood ceilings, walls and floors were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Excellent, professional care.
