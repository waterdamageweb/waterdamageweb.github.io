<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. Once this combustible fuel - carpet, drywall, or furniture - has been warmed to its special ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and volatile gases will be released in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and must be handled by skilled experts, heat is the most noticeable, and destructive, item of this chain reaction.

<p>Attics that aren't well aerated will often trap warm, moist air in the cold weather. This can lead 2 to mold impacting the rafters and wall studs. Expect to pay in between $500 and $1,000 for remediation in little locations, but if the entire attic is impacted it can cost as much as $4,000. Attics might need to have insulation removed to get at the most afflicted locations, which can raise the costs.
