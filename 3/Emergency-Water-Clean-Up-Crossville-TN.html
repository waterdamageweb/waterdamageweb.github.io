They came back every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the method and also were extremely useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
