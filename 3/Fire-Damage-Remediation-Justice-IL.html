Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
