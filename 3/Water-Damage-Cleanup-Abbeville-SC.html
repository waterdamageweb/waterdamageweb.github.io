<p>Last but not least, we want to address the use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical level of sensitivities particularly if used in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at getting rid of mold than a moderate cleaning agent and a moist cloth, so we suggest the least toxic alternative.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide eliminates mold as it is anti-fungal in addition to anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Hydrogen peroxide is a good option to chlorine bleach since it is safe to utilize and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave behind toxic residue or produce harmful fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can purchase hydrogen peroxide from drug stores for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
