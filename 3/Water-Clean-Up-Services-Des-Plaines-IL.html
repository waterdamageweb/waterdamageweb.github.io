<p>Unfavorable air machines, equipped with HEPA (high effectiveness particulate air filters") should be used to remove bacteria and other contaminants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be drawn out with self-contained vacuum devices with correct waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of correctly.

Any product that soaks up considerable quantities of wetness and can not be adequately cleaned up should be eliminated. Once polluted products have been eliminated, a 2nd application of sanitizers must be applied to all work surfaces.</p>
