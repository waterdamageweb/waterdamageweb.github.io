<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>To avoid mold in the basement, you need to modify the conditions that can cause it to grow.
