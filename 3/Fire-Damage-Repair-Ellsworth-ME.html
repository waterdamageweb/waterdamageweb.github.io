Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he discovered how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
