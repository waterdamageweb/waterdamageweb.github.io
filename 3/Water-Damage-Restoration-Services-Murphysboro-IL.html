Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season.

Part of our tracking procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>
