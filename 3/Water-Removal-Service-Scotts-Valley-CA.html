<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Action online, and they were out within the hour. It was a severe experience, but everything they did for me was terrific. They best thing about First Reaction was that they had the ability to handle my insurance company when they were offering me issues. This most likely helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and handled the concern for me, which was a substantial relief. They were really professional, and I liked everybody I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were managed to my satisfaction. I would use them again.<p>
