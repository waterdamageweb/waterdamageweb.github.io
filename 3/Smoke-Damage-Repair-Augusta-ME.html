<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Augusta</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold experts typically recommend is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush till the mold vanishes. There's no requirement to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This could worsen the problem because as you know - mold loves moist environments.<p>
