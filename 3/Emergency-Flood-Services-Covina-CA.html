The same density is used for ceilings, however 3/4 inch is not uncommon where the design called for more rigidity. For arches and curves, 1/4 inch is used. While it comes in 4' x 8' sheets, many home centers do stock smaller pieces and some will even cut pieces to size for you for a rate.<p>
<p>We can prevent additional damage. Flooding can spawn additional problems like structural damage and the development of mold and mildew. We can hinder this damage with a comprehensive evaluation of the property, and an appropriate plan of action on how to totally dry it out.

We understand the trauma of dealing with property and personal effects or contents damage and make it our objective to return our clients' lives to regular as quickly as possible. This may technically be true, however these materials will take a long time to dry on their own. Even then, they will just dry on the surface area.
