<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were really valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
