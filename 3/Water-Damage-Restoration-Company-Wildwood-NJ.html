<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds.

When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
