The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

Pay special attention to pipes in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that might not be getting the exact same quantity of heat as other locations in your home.
