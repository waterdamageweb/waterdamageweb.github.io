<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Drums</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and need to be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>Also, because bleach is mainly water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily taken in by the material.

If there is a lot of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other guidance documents are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the moldy material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be necessary.<p>
