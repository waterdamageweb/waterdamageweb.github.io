<p>Notification that the house is flooded? Do not waste time, and call a specialist right away. If you have no experience with the circumstance, a flooded home is not something that you can fix yourself. Call a water damage restoration company that can totally evaluate the extent of the damage, and can provide the best course of action. Don't even think about taking a hair dryer to your handset. Included heat could cause corrosion if there is any water on your phone's hardware. Rather, start with a soft, microfiber cloth, the kind you use to clean spots off of your glasses. Use a cloth to clean down the components inside if you can get rid of the back panel of your phone.<p>
<p>Water damage can lead to mold growth within 48 hours and require even more investment to repair if you do not respond quickly. We will then eliminate the contents of the room or space to an unaffected location, being particularly mindful not to cross-contaminate.
