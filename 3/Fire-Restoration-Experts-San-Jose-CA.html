<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly destructive. We engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged specialist on the biological elements of air contamination, this group was assigned to confirm and check the new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a new mold-assessment system for commercial customers that, unlike any other technique or device, can provide scientifically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can buy gadgets to determine relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air circulation near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of wetness in the home are all very essential in managing high humidity that frequently triggers mold growth in our environment.</p>
