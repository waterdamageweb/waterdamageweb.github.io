Other times, you might see small indications like coffee-colored discolorations that might broaden with time.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was simple: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that lawyers now declare came from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average yearly rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
