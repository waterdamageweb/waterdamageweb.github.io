<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.
