Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground.

Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is damp and good, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache due to the fact that the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water.
