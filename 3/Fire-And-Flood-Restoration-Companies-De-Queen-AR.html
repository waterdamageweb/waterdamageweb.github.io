It is important to rapidly control the moisture in the air and use sufficient air flow to dry the surface area of materials to reduce water activity, thus decreasing the capacity for microbial growth.

<p>Thoroughly shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating solution, then spray the affected location so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly throughout this process in order to make sure the service stays well mixed.) Permit the liquid to rest on the mold for 5 to 10 minutes so the anti-bacterial residential or commercial properties have time to overcome the gunk.
