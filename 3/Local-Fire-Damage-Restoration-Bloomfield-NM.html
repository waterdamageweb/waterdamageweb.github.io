<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore defense, and cover hands, legs and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove visible mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will reduce the occurrence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize business black mold removal items, which can be discovered in many hardware or home repair shops, to decontaminate the musty locations, in addition to any adjacent areas. If you utilize bleach, make sure it will not tarnish the product or surface. Location all sponges, devices and other products used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, remove the bag through a neighboring exit rather than the main home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
