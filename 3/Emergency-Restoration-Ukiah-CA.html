<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Ukiah</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health threat and must be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>Also, because bleach is primarily water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly taken in by the material. So, while you may have rubbed out or stained the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've really provided lots of water to regrow and potentially spread out the mold underneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold development, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other guidance files are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the musty product is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be needed.<p>
