<p>With over 40 years of building and construction background, Elite Restoration is your very first require wind, water, fire, or any other property damage. It's an unfortunate fact that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Most likely the most common is the smashed screen, which we talk about in our post on getting a damaged iPhone repaired But the 2nd most common is water damage. Parts of a water-damaged home might need to be reconstructed. Materials like drywall and carpet that have actually absorbed water frequently establish germs and mold that can't be removed. Replacing these products is safer than enabling infectious organisms to saturate the air.<p>
<p>Additionally, although ammonia can kill surface mold, dead mold and dead mold spores are still allergenic so you will need to make sure to eliminate them later on. A most likely scenario, unfortunately, is that your iPhone was turned on, or in sleep mode, when you dropped it in the beverage. So you're taking a look at 2 unattractive choices: power down (but in the process cause the screen and operating system to wake up briefly prior to turning off) or leave the device in sleep mode and hope you do not get any notifications.<p>
