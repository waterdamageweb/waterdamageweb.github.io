There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days.
