<p>During a flood cleanup, the indoor air quality in your house or office may seem the least of your issues. However, failure to remove infected materials and to reduce wetness and humidity can present major long-lasting health risks. Standing water and wet materials are a breeding ground for bacteria, such as viruses, germs, and mold. They can cause disease, trigger allergies, and continue to damage materials long after the flood.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>

They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.
