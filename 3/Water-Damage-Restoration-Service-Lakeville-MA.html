<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very costly paperweight.</p>

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
