<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Clemmons</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and need to be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
