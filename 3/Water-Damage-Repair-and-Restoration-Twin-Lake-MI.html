<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Twin Lake</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health danger and must be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
