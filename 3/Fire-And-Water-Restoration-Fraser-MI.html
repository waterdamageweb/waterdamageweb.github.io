<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold professionals generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such materials take in water easily. This could exacerbate the problem because as you understand - mold loves moist environments.<p>
