<p>Not to complicate the matter, but to add some clarity to the concern of mold, mold spores threaten. They threaten whether alive or dead. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning.

Water intrusion where wet, porous products (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where materials referred to as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually soaked up very little wetness.</p>
