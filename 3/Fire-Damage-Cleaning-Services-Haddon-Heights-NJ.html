Gradually, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and exhausted  space.<p>
<p>In order to protect yourself from germs in the water, mold on surfaces and the chemicals in cleaning products, cover your body. Use pants, long sleeves, boots, and rubber gloves.
