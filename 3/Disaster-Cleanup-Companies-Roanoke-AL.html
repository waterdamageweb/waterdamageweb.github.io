<p>They called me morning and asked me for assistance. I showed up to access the situation and found the water was going through the floor to the downstairs ceilings and all the drywall was ruined.

<p>Since it's impossible to eliminate mold in your home totally, it is essential to keep your air clear by routinely changing air filters. Think about using High Performance Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are designed to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or bigger (mold is generally 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from distributing. You may also consider an air cleanser that will eliminate mold spores. Find one with an antimicrobial filter to make sure that the filter itself remains free from mold if you live in an especially damp environment.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any adjustments if you have concerns on this.</p>
<p>We use advanced digital wetness meters developed to specifically check for proper wetness material in various types of structure materials. Some materials will take on more water than others, and some products can be more challenging to dry.
