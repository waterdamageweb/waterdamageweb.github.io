<p>Smoke damage is a typical negative effects of fire damage, but it can happen on its own if a fire is contained. After the standing water has been removed and products that could present a drying or structural hazard have been eliminated, the drying process will start. This frequently includes placing fans and a dehumidifier in the location. Sometimes, it may also involve putting up plastic sheeting and utilizing heaters so that the water can evaporate. It might be necessary to remove baseboards or drill holes so that they dry correctly if walls have actually been impacted. An area of the carpet might also need to be raised so that the carpet and the pad will dry. If these procedures aren't performed, the chance of odor and mold growth increases There's also an opportunity of structural damage occurring from excessive wetness.</p>
