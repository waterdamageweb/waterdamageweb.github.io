<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Reaction online, and they were out within the hour. It was a severe experience, however everything they did for me was terrific. They best thing about First Reaction was that they were able to manage my insurance company when they were giving me problems. This probably assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and handled the problem for me, which was a big relief. They were very expert, and I liked everyone I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were dealt with to my complete satisfaction. I would utilize them once again.<p>
