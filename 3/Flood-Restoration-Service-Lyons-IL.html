<p>Before you clean the house, you must wear correct defense. Soot, particles and smoke can be hazardous to breathe in, so use a respirator if there is substantial soot in the damaged area. Wear long pants and sleeves to secure your skin. You need to also use gloves and eye defense. Given that you will be freeing soot as you clean, it's important to set floor protection and remove any furniture or household objects that are not damaged. If the damaged area is small, you can probably get away with just covering furniture with plastic or sheets.
