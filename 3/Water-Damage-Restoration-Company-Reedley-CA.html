<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our soaked crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the method and also were really useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>

<p>Under the law, it is your right to determine what company will perform work in your home or business. Some insurance coverage providers have preferred contractors" that they suggest, who have agreements with the insurer to handle water losses in a particular way, and at pre-determined prices. You must be aware that these companies might count on these recommendations from the insurance coverage providers for their company's income. This could develop a conflict of interest. These companies may not hold the protection of your health and home as their top priority. Bales works for you; safeguarding your interest, not simply the insurance provider's, even if they do recommend Bales.</p>
