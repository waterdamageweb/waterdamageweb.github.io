<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable signs of moisture, leaking water, or indications of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might collapse or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you might discover little indications like coffee-colored stains that may broaden in time.</p>
<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also in some cases described as mildew, is a fungal development that establishes on wet products.

Mold reproduce by means of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but undetectable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature, wetness, and offered nutrient conditions are right, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are deposited. 1 There are many kinds of mold, but all require moisture and a food source for development.</p>
