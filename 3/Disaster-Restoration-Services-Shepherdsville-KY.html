<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Shepherdsville</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and should be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
