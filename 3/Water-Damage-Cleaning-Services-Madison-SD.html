<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege originated from pressure to develop much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little government and contractor oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>

<p>Vapor pressure is directly related to humidity ratio (particular humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is applied to a product, energy is added. Raising the temperature of a wet material increases the rate of evaporation, further releasing moisture from the material and changing the internal vapor pressure. The higher the difference between ambient temperature and dew point temperature, the greater the potential for faster and more efficient drying.</p>
