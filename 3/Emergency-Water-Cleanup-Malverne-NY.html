<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the place the spores land is damp and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally advise discarding certain kinds of surfaces and things. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical items in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup procedure, which also includes vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or small particles neglected in the remediation process. An unique HEPA vacuum makes sure that even tiny particles get gathered to lessen the possibilities of the mold moving somewhere else. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make twice as sure that mold doesn't find a way out of the included workspace and into a different part of the building.</p>
