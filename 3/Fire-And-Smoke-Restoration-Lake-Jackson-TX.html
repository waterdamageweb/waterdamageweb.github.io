<p>11. Drywall and other kinds of wall materials usually don't dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's generally best to rip them out to avoid mold, especially if they aren't totally dry within 2 days. Like bleach, ammonia will kill mold on difficult non-porous surface areas such as countertops, glass or tiles but it is inadequate at eliminating mold growing in porous material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>If walls have currently dried, work from the floor to the ceiling to prevent streaking. (Filthy water splashed on dry walls might be soaked up and ended up being nearly difficult to eliminate.)
