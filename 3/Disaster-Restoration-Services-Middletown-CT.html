<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, try to preserve the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can purchase gadgets to determine relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to lessen the production of moisture in the home are all very important in controlling high humidity that often triggers mold growth in our environment.</p>

<p>Drying Out: Once the mold is consisted of in a room, we continue to clear it out and then dry off the wetness.
