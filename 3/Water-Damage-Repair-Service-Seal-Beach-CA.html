<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, however it can take place on its own if a fire is contained. It is your obligation to pay the deductible if you make a claim with your provider. It is traditional for restoration contractors to collect the deductible in advance when work is to start, and we will notify your insurance provider in such circumstances. Other times, your deductible may be subtracted" from the last insurance check, in which case you would pay the deductible quantity at the end of the job. Another possibility is that your insurance carrier take the deductible quantity off of the amount they owe you for your individual contents. In all these cases, you ultimately pay your deductible, either to Flagship or in another manner.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to build quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little federal government and builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average yearly rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
