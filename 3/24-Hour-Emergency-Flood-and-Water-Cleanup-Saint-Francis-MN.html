They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
