As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts.

This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
