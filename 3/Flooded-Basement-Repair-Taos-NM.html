<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in assisting us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.
