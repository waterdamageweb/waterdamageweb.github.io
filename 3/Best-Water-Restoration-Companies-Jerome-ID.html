<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As mentioned, quick air motion throughout wet surfaces of products or assemblies is a critical element of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies.

The continuous and falling rates of drying products require various criteria for changing conditions.</p>
