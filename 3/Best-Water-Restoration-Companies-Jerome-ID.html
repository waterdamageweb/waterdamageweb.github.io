<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As mentioned, quick air motion throughout wet surfaces of products or assemblies is a critical element of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies.

Quick air movement throughout the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface area wetness gives way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require various criteria for changing conditions.</p>
