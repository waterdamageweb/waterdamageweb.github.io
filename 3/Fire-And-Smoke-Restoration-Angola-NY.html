This can result from any number of scenarios such as flooding, water build-up after a fire, a damaged pipeline, or perhaps a malfunctioning HEATING AND COOLING system - all of which can cause trouble. Any high degree of wetness, combined with temperature and nutrients, develops the best environment for the fungal components of mold and mildew to grow. It is important to remove the source of the moisture to prevent the spread of mold contamination as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
