Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve.
