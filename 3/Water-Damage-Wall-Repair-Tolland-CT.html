<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is outstanding insurance coverage to have in any scenario, especially when the water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater is imminent unless repaired rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The culprit may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are utilized on any tough surfaces to get rid of the mold from the surface area. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furnishings, clothing, or toys, these are usually brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are removed, normally involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
