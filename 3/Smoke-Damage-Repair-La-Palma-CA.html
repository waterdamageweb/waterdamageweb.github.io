<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health danger, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish degeneration of materials (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you combine electricity, metal, oxygen and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no trusted schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components normally begin wearing away immediately after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of a problem. How quickly the rust process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
