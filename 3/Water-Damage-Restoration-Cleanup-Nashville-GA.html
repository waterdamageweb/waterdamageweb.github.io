The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective.

These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely predicts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure products and how they respond to each one and supply the very best evaporation outcomes.

However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
