<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air movement across wet surfaces of products or assemblies is a vital element of efficiently and effectively drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials. Quick air motion throughout the surface area of product becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area wetness gives way to minimizing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying products need various requirements for changing conditions.</p>
<p>If you have actually simply experienced a water event, you might be questioning what to do next: Permeating water damage is progressive, pervasive and can imply valuable things may become permanently damaged - specifically if emergency response is delayed beyond the very first two days. When moisture leaks into products of value there are immediate actions that can be taken to reduce the amount of long-term damage that results.</p>
