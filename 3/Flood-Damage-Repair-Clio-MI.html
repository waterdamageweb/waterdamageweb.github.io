<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, provided the nature of basements - they tend to be much more humid than above-ground levels and normally have poor ventilation and little air circulation, a combination that can trigger mold to grow. And of course, basements can be prone to flooding, due to severe weather or undetected leakages in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, as soon as mold establishes, cinder block or concrete walls can be tough to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health threat, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
