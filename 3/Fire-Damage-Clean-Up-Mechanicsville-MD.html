<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Mechanicsville</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health threat and ought to be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can eliminate water vapor from the air in a contained area, like a bed room or downstairs rec space.
