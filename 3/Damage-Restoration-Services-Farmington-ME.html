<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
