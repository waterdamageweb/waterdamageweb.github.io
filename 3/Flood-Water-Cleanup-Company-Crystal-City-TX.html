<p>Remediation specialists must divulge, in writing, when and how they are differing the ANSI requirement. This includes if they do both testing and remediation, as that is considered a conflict of interest. We encourage that the conditions be examined pre- and post-remediation by an independent certified expert which a separate licensed remediation company carry out the work. When not possible, the reason that must be mentioned (e.g. remote locations may not have both).<p>
