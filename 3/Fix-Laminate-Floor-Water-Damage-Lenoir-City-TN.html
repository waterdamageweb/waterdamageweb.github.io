<h3>Water Mitigation in Lenoir City Tennessee</h2>
<p>If there are dark spots on your ceiling, walls or floors, this is a sure indication of mold development. Moldy smells and mildew are typically signs that mold might be growing in your house.

Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical sensitivities especially if used in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at removing mold than a moderate detergent and a damp fabric, so we advise the least toxic alternative.</p>

Some materials will handle more water than others, and some materials can be more challenging to dry.
