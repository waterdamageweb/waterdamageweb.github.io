<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are great for drying in difficult to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and cushioning. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout wet surface areas, vaporizing moisture into the air. With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an enough number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>Water damage is one of the primary causes of mold growing on the walls and ceilings of a house. Any indication of extreme wetness, moldy odors or mold should be taken on as quickly as possible to prevent more complications that might trigger health problems and serious damage to the house. Mold inspections are often useful to detect any type of mold growing in your home, specifically those that may affect your health negatively.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
