<p>Rust is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the gradual and sluggish degeneration of materials (generally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you integrate electrical energy, oxygen, metal and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal parts normally begin rusting immediately after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of an issue. How quick the deterioration procedure takes depends on a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can resolve the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
