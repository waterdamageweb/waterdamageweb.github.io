<p>Flooding of a private sewage system can be a harmful situation for property owners, according to Pipes 2.0's veteran plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might result in a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and absence of sanitation until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewer system can not operate correctly (typical pipes problems in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to lower the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, germs and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those hazardous materials can go into the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>
