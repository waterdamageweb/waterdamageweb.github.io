<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As discussed, rapid air motion across wet surface areas of assemblies or products is a crucial component of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or products. Rapid air motion throughout the surface area of material ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area wetness gives way to minimizing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
