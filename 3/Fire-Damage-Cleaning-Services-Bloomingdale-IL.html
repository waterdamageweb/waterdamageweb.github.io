<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
