<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
