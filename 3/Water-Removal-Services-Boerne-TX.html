<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal visible signs of moisture, leaking water, or signs of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you may observe little indications like coffee-colored stains that may broaden over time.</p>

For these reasons try to avoid utilizing bleach and if you should use it, only utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
