<p>Class 1 - least amount of water, absorption, and evaporation load.

<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Eagle Point</h3>
<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Reaction online, and they were out within the hour. It was a severe experience, however whatever they provided for me was terrific. They best thing about First Reaction was that they had the ability to handle my insurer when they were giving me problems. This most likely assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the problem for me, which was a big relief. They were very professional, and I liked everybody I handled from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were handled to my satisfaction. I would use them again.<p>
<p>To kill mold: Use white distilled vinegar and pour it into a spray bottle without watering it down. Spray the vinegar onto the moldy surface area and leave it to sit for an hour. Finally, clean the location clean with water and allow the surface area to dry. Any odor from the vinegar must clear within a few hours. Whether or not you wish to sue might depend upon your approximated costs, your deductible, and your particular policy. Fischer recommends that you review your particular policy, and connect to your insurance company as early as possible at the same time so you can get the best assistance on whether and when to file an actual claim.<p>
