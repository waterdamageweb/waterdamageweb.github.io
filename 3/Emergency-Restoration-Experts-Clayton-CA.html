There is moisture staying in structural products (e.g., plywood, particle board, structural wood, VCT, concrete, and so on).

<h3>Flood Damage Cleaning Clayton CA 94517</h3>
<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can offer your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and broke chimney can often let in rain throughout the cooler months which can permeate through the walls. Over time, wetness from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and exhausted  space.<p>
<p>Open flooded walls, even if they appear undamaged, to prevent mold, odor, and structural decay later. We live and work in this community too; we may even be next-door neighbors. As an in your area owned and run organisation, SERVPRO of Montgomery is nearby and ready to react to storm and disaster occasions.
