Hard surfaces that are affected need to be cleaned and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpets, carpet pads, plaster wallboard need to be eliminated and appropriately gotten rid of.

Once infected products have actually been removed, a second application of sanitizers must be used to all work surfaces.</p>
