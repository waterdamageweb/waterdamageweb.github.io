<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape.

Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
