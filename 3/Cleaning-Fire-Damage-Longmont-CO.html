<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By reducing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is essential to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is completed.<p>
