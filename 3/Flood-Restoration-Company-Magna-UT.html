<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
