<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

But mold removal, officially called mold remediation, can become your fixation when allergic reactions or continuous sinus problems plague you.<p>

While every job is different, here is an idea of the process we follow. For comprehensive information about your case, consult with a mold remediation specialist.
