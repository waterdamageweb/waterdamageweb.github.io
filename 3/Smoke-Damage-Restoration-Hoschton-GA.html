<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get damp and just begins to sag before drying, fixing it may simply require pushing it back into location, securing it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Mold is a fungis that can be discovered both indoors and outdoors. Nobody understands how many species of mold exist but estimates variety from tens of thousands to perhaps three hundred thousand or more. Mold spreads and recreates by making spores. Spores can survive conditions that are too warm, hot, cold, damp or dry for mold to grow. They can be carried by air or water to brand-new areas when spores are released.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every two to three rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
