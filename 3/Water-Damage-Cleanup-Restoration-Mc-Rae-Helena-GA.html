If the plants and fauna of your community chooses to settle in on your roof, it's going to start to wear and deteriorate quicker. Talk with a professional specialist if you see your roofing searching in need of some attention.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you actually want to avoid purchasing a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this solution and wipe it straight over mold growth.
