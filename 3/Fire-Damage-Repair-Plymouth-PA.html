The best method to inform is to get it tested by a professional industrial hygienist.

Expect to pay between $500 and $1,000 for remediation in small locations, however if the whole attic is affected it can cost as much as $4,000.

<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Plymouth</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and must be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

Any home appliances that were swamped by flood water must be inspected by a professional prior to you use them.<p>
