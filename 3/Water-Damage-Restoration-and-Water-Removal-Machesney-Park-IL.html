<p>Many extremely contagious health problems are linked to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, breathing infections, and Weil's disease, in addition to blood, liver, and kidney problems.

Perhaps this is why some individuals think that spraying bleach on mold does not impact it however instead simply bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
