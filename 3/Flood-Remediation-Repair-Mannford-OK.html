<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall materials normally do not dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's typically best to rip them out to prevent mold, especially if they aren't completely dry within 2 days.

<p>Note: While a lot of experts suggest a relative humidity of less than 60%, listed below 50% is best for controlling both mold growth and allergen. Allergen are microscopic animals connected to spiders, ticks and other mites. Allergen eat mold and dead human or animal skin scales (flakes) and leave allergenic proteins.
