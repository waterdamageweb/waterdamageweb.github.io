Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed instead of being totally changed. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might need fixing. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor may need changing and in some cases even the subfloor as well. The type of wood floor covering you may have figures out and restricts the type of repairs that need to take place. Solid hardwood flooring allows for a wider range of choices to fix the issue. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This type of floor covering can likewise have replacements for individual planks. The very best method to look after a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
