<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Step the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you understand just how much new wallboard you require. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, use your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and then protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel fulfills. Then use joint compound over the tape, using a putty knife. Let the compound dry for the time defined by the maker and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper until the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
