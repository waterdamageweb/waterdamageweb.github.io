<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can provide your living-room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, however a weathered and cracked chimney can frequently let in rain throughout the cooler months which can seep through the walls. In time, wetness from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to peel, flake and bubble. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a exhausted and unloved area.<p>
<p>Open all windows in the room to help with the drying process. If there are cabinets in the room, they should be exposed, too. Prevent shutting the door to the affected area considering that you do not want to promote mold development.
