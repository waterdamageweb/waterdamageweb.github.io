<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health risk, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet.

If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
