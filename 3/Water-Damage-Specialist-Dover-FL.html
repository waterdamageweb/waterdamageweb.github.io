To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products take in water easily.
