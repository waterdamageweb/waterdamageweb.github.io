<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Payson</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health risk and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>After the flood waters decline and the clean up has actually been done, many folks want to get back into their organisations or houses and start rebuilding. The problem is that wood that has actually been submerged in water has actually likely soaked up a big quantity of water. Rebuilding too quickly after a flood can cause continuing issues such as mold growth, insect infestations, and deterioration of the wood and wall coverings.<p>
