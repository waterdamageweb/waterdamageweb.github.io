<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Negative air makers, geared up with HEPA (high performance particulate air filters") need to be used to remove bacteria and other contaminants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum equipment with correct waste holding tanks which should be disposed of properly. Hard surface areas that are affected need to be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpets, rug, plaster wallboard need to be gotten rid of and correctly dealt with. Any product that soaks up significant amounts of wetness and can not be sufficiently cleaned need to be gotten rid of. Once polluted products have actually been removed, a 2nd application of sanitizers should be used to all work surfaces.</p>
