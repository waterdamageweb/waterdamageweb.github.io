<p>Whether your home has been flooded by broken pipelines or a leaky roof, it is very important to get rid of all infected and wet products in your home as soon as possible. I had the men come in for a second opinion and to carry out an air quality test. If it weren't for them, let's just say I 'd still be standing on water with mold concerns.

<p>After scrubbing the surfaces, allow the bleach solution to continue to penetrate the surfaces and dry.

Fans will blow air across the surface area and cause the water to evaporate, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it won't kick back into the material and trigger additional damage to the space.<p>
