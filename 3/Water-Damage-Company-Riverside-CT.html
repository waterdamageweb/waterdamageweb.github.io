Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air pollution, this group was appointed to verify and evaluate the new technology.

Together, we had the ability to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial consumers that, unlike any other method or device, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>

LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or boosted step to decrease the moisture-laden air temperature once inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>

<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.
