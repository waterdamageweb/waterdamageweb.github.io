<p>With over 40 years of building background, Elite Restoration is your first call for wind, water, fire, or any other home damage. It's a sad truth that iPhones get dropped and damaged all the time. Probably the most common is the smashed screen, which we talk about in our article on getting a damaged iPhone fixed However the 2nd most typical is water damage.

A most likely situation, sadly, is that your iPhone was turned on, or in sleep mode, when you dropped it in the drink. So you're looking at 2 unattractive options: power down (however at the same time cause the screen and operating system to wake up briefly before turning off) or leave the device in sleep mode and hope you don't get any notifications.<p>
