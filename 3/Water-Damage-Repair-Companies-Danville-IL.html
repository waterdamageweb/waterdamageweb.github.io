<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.</p>
