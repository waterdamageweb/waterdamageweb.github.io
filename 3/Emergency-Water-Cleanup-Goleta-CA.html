<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying since the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Very respectful and easy-going person.</p>
