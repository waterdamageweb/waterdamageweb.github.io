<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include browsing a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
