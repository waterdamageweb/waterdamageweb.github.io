<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling because of a leaky roof, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and irritation, specifically if you have actually never ever done it previously. Mold requires just three things to grow and make it through: wetness, humidity and darkness. The most common areas in your home for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling home appliances, carpets, ducts and crawlspaces. The best way to prevent mold development is to eliminate water leakages or wetness in your home. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold avoidance tips.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache since the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply starts to sag before drying out, repairing it may just need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Thoroughly shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating solution, then spray the afflicted location so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle consistently throughout this process in order to make sure the solution stays well combined.)

Never scrape dried mold, or else the harmful spores might spread into air and trigger negative health impacts.</p>
