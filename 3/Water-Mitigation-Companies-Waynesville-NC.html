<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken.

<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also gives off extreme fumes and it even produces toxic gas when combined with ammonia.
