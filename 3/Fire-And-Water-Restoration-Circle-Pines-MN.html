<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>Basements are very common areas for mold to take hold and grow. They tend to get damp, which makes the ideal conditions for growing mold in corners and on floorings and walls.

Clean up consists of scrubbing down the impacted locations, using dehumidifiers to dry the area, and air scrubbers to help get rid of spores.</p>

<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to complete.<p>
