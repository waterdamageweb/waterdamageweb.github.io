It might be covered by insurance coverage when a product already covered under your homeowners insurance breaks mistakenly-- for example, if your pipes unexpectedly ruptures and water floods your home, the property owners insurance will cover part or all of the expenses for the plumbing repair and any mold remediation expenses needed as a direct result of the water damage.<p>

There are over 100,000 kinds of species of mold, however the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days.
