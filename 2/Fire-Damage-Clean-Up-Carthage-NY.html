<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth discovering. When the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>
