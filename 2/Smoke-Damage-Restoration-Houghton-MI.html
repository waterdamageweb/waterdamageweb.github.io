<p>Also, given that bleach is mainly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly taken in by the material. So, while you might have rubbed out or tarnished the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually offered lots of water to grow back and potentially spread out the mold below the surface area. If there is a lot of mold development, speak with the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ". Printable variations of these and other assistance documents are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy product is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be necessary.<p>
