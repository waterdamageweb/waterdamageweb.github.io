<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or polluted water. A fireplace can offer your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, but a weathered and cracked chimney can often let in rain throughout the chillier months which can leak through the walls. Gradually, moisture from the water can cause the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into a tired and unloved space.<p>
<p>When dealing with damp drywall, remember to use safety goggles and masks. If you're dealing with a basement flood circumstance, utilize a laser level or other device to mark 6 inches above the waterline around the room.

They likely will not cover mold remediation expenses if the insurance company can determine that the mold damage is an outcome of your neglect. Your homeowner's insurance coverage likely will not cover the loss if you do not have flood insurance. If the flood has been declared a federal disaster by the President, look for assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>
