<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Chillicothe</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold specialists usually recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This could exacerbate the problem due to the fact that as you know - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>
