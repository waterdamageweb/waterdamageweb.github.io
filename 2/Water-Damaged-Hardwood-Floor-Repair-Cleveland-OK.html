<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
