<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up.

Desiccants can quickly run listed below freezing temperature levels.</p>
<p>When your home floods, the water can wreak havoc on the structure of your home, your belongings, and the health of the within environment. Flood waters contain lots of pollutants and lots of mud.
