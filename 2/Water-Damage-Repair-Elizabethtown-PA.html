<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are excellent for drying in tough to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more effective when drying under carpet and padding. Much like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout damp surfaces, evaporating wetness into the air. With making use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an adequate variety of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
