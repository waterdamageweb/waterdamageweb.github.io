<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
