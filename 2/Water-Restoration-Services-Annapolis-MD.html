<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also derive nutrients from some artificial items such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires moisture, although some mold species can obtain that wetness from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards away from walls so that you can check sheetrock at floor level. The porous material can rapidly absorb flood water, and you need to understand the level of prospective damage.<p>
