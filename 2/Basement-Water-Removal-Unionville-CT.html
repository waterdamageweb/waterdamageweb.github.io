<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
