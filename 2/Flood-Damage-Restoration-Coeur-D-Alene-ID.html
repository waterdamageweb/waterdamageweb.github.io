Initially, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical level of sensitivities specifically if utilized in locations that are not well ventilated.

<p>Because big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches might require a total replacement panel installed. It depends upon where the damage is located on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out.
