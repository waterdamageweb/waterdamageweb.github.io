<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or service is among the most terrible things that can happen to a family or a person. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being totally replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard may require fixing, if there is small damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the whole floor may require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The type of wood floor covering you might have determines and limits the type of repair work that need to happen. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a wider series of alternatives to repair the issue. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for specific slabs. The very best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
