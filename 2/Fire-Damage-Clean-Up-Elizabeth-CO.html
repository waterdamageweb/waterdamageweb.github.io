<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Over time, roofs may establish dark streaks. It may be dirt that can be simply power-washed off, or it may be mold. You shouldn't have anything growing, and even developing a welcoming environment, for animals, bugs, or birds. It's going to start to wear and break down much faster if the plants and animals of your area chooses to settle in on your roofing.

Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can trigger wetness on the underside of the roofing, which can lead to mold and rotting. When inspecting your home for possible reasons for water damage be sure to keep an eye out for moisture in light fixtures as well as the general condition of any visible piping.</p>
