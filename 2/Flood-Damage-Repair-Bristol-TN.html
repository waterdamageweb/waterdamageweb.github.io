<p>Using bleach or other chemicals to eliminate indoor mold growth is not needed for the most part. The goal must be to eliminate mold development by cleaning or removing moldy materials. If you are exposed, dead mold can still posture health risks. Utilizing bleach or other disinfectants on surface areas after mold removal may be required where individuals are believed to be susceptible to fungal infections (such as a person with immune system problems). Should you decide to utilize bleach or another chemical, please read and thoroughly follow the label directions and risk statements (caution, warning, risk). Do not blend bleach with ammonia cleaners or acids, because a hazardous chlorine gas may be formed.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications.</p>
