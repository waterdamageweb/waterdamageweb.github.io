<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, however it can occur by itself if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier produces the most affordable humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in wetness through chemical tourist attraction instead of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a material that attracts and holds wetness. This material acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated up exhaust air, the moisture evaporates (desorption) and is brought outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water build-up.
