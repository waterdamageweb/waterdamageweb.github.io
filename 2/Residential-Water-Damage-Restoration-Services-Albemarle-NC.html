<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper).

<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical.

For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you must utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
