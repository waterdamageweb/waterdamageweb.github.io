The owner utilized a fire extinguisher to put out the fire but after smoke and soot took a trip throughout the house of this two-story home it was impacted in various methods.

Water and sewage need to be extracted, and the affected areas expertly cleaned, aerated, dried and decontaminated as quickly as possible to lower bacteria, mold. and other damaging microbe development, which can trigger additional damage to the property on top of water damage and create possible health threats for your family or employees.<p>
