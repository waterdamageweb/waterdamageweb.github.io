<p>Indoor mold growth can usually be seen or smelled. Most of the times, if noticeable mold development is present, tasting is not required. There are no health or exposure-based standards that you can utilize to assess a mold tasting outcome. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold screening or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what sort of mold may be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be costly and, if done, should just be done by experienced experts. Examine a mold issue; don't test</p>
<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
<p>A final assessment helps find any possible place where mold might still prowl. Surface areas with contamination and mold are eliminated and ruined and the work area is cleaned up.
