<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and need to be removed.

This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
