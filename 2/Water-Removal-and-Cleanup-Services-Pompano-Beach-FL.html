<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Pompano Beach</h3>
<p>It is easy for a property owner to think the damage to their home or company is limited to the aesthetically verified damage. At FP Property Restoration, we understand that this is not the case. Surrounding locations, contents, ventilation systems, and surface areas are all impacted by smoke, water from the extinguishment of the fire, and the recurring odor that, if not dealt with correctly, will never ever leave your home.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other home disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Attempt to keep yourself, kids, employees and others out of the affected location. Attempting to dry the area with a fan may disturb the spores and spread them to a brand-new area. Getting rid of black mold is a detailed procedure that needs persistence, a financial investment in protective equipment and black mold removal items, and, of course, the courage to brave dark, confined spaces populated by poisonous fungus.<p>
