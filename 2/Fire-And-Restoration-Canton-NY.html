Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days.
