<p>Open doors and windows to remove moisture and smells if the weather condition allows. If the outside humidity ends up being higher than inside, close things up; similarly, close up your house overnight if temperature levels drop and damp air might otherwise be drawn inside. If windows are stuck tight, remove window strips and eliminate whole sash. If doors are stuck, eliminate door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then remove.</p>
