<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
