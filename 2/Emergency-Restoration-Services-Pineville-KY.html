<p>If smoke and fire damage has impacted your belongings, we will work with you and your insurance provider to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which penetrates into permeable surface, avoiding water from leaking back through. Essentially, it makes the area strong again and protects the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>Additionally, although ammonia can kill surface area mold, dead mold and dead mold spores are still allergenic so you will need to ensure to eliminate them afterwards. A most likely situation, unfortunately, is that your iPhone was turned on, or in sleep mode, when you dropped it in the drink.
