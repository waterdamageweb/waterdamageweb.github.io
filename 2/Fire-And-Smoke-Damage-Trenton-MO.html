<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted sprawling suburban homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics built with products besides stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
