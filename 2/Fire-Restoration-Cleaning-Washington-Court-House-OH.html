<p>Then, if water has penetrated to the subfloor, we will continue water extraction there, and institute drying procedures for the subfloor using dehumidifiers and air movers. Then service technicians will examine your residential or commercial property for any additional structural damage. Cost assessments: Sometimes it is more expense reliable to utilize less devices over a somewhat longer period of time. Often it is more cost efficient to take longer to dry versus to repair and demolish.<p>
