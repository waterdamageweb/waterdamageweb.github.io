<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or service is among the most devastating things that can occur to an individual or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being completely replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor may need changing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The kind of wood flooring you might have identifies and limits the type of repairs that need to occur. Strong hardwood flooring permits a broader series of options to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface.
