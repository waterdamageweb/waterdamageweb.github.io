<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
