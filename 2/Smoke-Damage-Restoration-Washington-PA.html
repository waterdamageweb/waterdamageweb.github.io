<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Wear a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore defense, and cover hands, legs and arms to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of noticeable mold. If the musty location is dry, gently spray with water, as this will lower the occurrence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal products, which can be discovered in many hardware or home repair shops, to decontaminate the moldy locations, in addition to any surrounding areas. If you use bleach, make certain it won't discolor the material or surface area. Place all sponges, devices and other products utilized in cleaning in a strong trash can, and if possible, remove the bag through a close-by exit rather than the primary house, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
