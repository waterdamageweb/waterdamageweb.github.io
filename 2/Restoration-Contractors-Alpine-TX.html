<p>The location that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily take a trip when they are interrupted. Air filtration systems are generally used in conjunction with the sealing of the location to remove as lots of airborne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the location includes the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, as well as unfavorable atmospheric pressure, which avoids the circulation of air in between the contaminated area and the locations around it.

Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach disappears effective at eliminating mold than a damp fabric and a mild detergent, so we recommend the least hazardous choice.</p>
