<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the sluggish and gradual wear and tear of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust occurs when you combine electrical energy, metal, oxygen and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no trusted schedule for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal elements usually begin wearing away right away after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem. How quickly the rust process takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all till you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration caused by a water spill.</p>
