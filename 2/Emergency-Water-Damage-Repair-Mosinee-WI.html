<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a severe health risk. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By minimizing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
