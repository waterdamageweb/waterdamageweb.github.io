The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to assess which drying devices or approaches will be the most efficient. It is vital to figure out if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they respond to each one and offer the very best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
