<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Black mold can be hazardous to your health, primarily triggering respiratory problems. However in extreme cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you might wish to purchase a mold testing package to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and hire an expert to aid with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home remedies (made with things you most likely already have on-hand) that will help remove mold.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the beginning point for numerous severe issues that can affect a structure, damage personal effects and present severe health threats to residents.

Furthermore, they need to be able to interact with the water damage victims and insurance company representatives with confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the ideal breeding location for mold, while poor indoor ventilation can trigger molds to thrive. Wet building products and humid indoor air are mold's buddies.</p>
