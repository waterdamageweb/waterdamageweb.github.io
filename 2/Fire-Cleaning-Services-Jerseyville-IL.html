<h3>Fire And Restoration in Jerseyville</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold vanishes. There's no need to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water easily. This could intensify the issue since as you understand - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>

<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to do the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
