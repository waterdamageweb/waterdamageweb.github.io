<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or polluted water. A fireplace can provide your living room a sense of warmth and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and broke chimney can typically allow rain during the cooler months which can permeate through the walls. Over time, moisture from the water can cause the paint on the wall to flake, bubble and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a worn out and unloved area.<p>

The Apple Watch Series 2 and later on have a similar problem, although they come with a built-in function that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a particular frequency. The worst issue with mold is that it has the possible to cause health effects. Mold can set off allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some individuals dislike mold.
