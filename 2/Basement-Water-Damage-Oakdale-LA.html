Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
