<h3>Residential Fire Damage Restoration in Drums</h3>
<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.<p>
