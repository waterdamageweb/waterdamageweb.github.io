<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a household or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>
