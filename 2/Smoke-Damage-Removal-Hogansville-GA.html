Examples of Classification 3 water can consist of, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap regardless of noticeable content or color; all kinds of flooding from seawater; ground surface area water and rising water from streams or rivers; and other infected water entering or impacting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from typhoons, tropical storms, or other weather associated events. Such water sources may bring silt, raw material, pesticides, heavy metals, controlled materials, or toxic natural substances.</p>
<p>Water damage emerges from broken pipelines, obstructed drains pipes, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends on the nature of the damage. Some water brings pollutants and should be considered hazardous.
