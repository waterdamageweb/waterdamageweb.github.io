Not just will these mold components move through your home in locations such as the floor, rafters or the ceiling, they can also cause conditions such as asthma, coughing or skin irritation.</p>

However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
