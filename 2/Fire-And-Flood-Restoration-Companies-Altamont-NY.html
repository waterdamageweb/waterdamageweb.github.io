Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
