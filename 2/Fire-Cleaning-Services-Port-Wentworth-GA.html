Experts have identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted stretching rural houses, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Residences constructed with materials other than stucco had issues, too. Some houses with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local firms. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Because the gypsum drywall is soluble and porous in water, getting it wet can become a major headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get wet and just begins to sag before drying out, repairing it may just need pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
