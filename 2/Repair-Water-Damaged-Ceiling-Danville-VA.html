We also set up portable heating fans to speed up the drying procedure.</p>

<h3>Fire Restoration Services in Danville</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
