<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Even as builders have combated claims, nearly 2 dozen house owners said that they were never ever alerted of any possible problem-- even as some structure executives knew of its level. Toll's vice president of construction, Anthony Geonnotti, for example, testified in 2017 that, within a little more than two years, he had examined 300 to 350 homes in the area for water intrusion-- with approximately 85 percent needing repair work, according to an arbitration hearing transcript submitted in court. Countless house owners have actually found the problems only after it's too late to bring a claim under state law-- with some missing the deadline by simply months or weeks.</p>

<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Response online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, but whatever they provided for me was fantastic. When they were giving me problems, they best thing about First Action was that they were able to handle my insurance coverage company. This probably assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and handled the issue for me, which was a huge relief. They were very expert, and I liked everybody I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were dealt with to my satisfaction. I would use them once again.<p>
