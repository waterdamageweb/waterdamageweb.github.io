A pipe burst in the attic can result in gallons of water raining down on the rooms inside your home.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas begins next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any hard surface areas to remove the mold from the surface area. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furnishings, clothes, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to make sure all mold spores are eliminated, typically involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
