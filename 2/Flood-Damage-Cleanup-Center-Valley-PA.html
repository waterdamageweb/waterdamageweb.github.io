You would be sorely incorrect.</p>
<p>The most effective way to prevent mold development on water damage is to start the drying process rapidly. Restoration companies that know possible mold development problems usually understand how to dry structural materials by reducing the indoor humidity, sensibly move air and sometimes heat the affected location.

<p>Rust is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and slow deterioration of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust occurs when you combine electricity, oxygen, metal and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reputable schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal parts normally start wearing away instantly after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can work generally for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of an issue.

The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
