<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
