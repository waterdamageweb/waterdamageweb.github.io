<h2>Flood Damage Insurance Claims in Lindale</h2>

<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
