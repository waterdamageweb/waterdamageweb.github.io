<p>Examine the drywall to see just how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or fall apart to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels only show water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised, they might be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When cutting out around the damaged location, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
