<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air motion throughout wet surface areas of assemblies or materials is a critical element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Fast air movement throughout the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface wetness gives way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying products require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
