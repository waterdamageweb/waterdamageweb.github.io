<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were incredible in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>

Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get damp and just starts to droop prior to drying, fixing it may just need pressing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
