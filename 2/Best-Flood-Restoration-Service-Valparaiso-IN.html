<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Valparaiso</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is necessary to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is ended up.<p>
