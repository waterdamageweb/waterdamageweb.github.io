<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then wipe it away with a wet towel. As with some of the above approaches, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
