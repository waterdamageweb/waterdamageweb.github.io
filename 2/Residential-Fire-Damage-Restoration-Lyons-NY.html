<p>Since typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
