<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold experts generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears.
