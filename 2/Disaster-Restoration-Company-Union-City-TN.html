<p>As the job progresses and the environment is supported, products can be dried by managing the humidity, energy, and airflow (heat). Even more into the drying, air motion must be re-directed and guarantee good transfer of energy to the remaining wet locations.

However, failure to get rid of infected materials and to decrease wetness and humidity can present major long-lasting health risks. Standing water and damp materials are a breeding ground for bacteria, such as viruses, bacteria, and mold. They can trigger illness, trigger allergies, and continue to damage products long after the flood.</p>
