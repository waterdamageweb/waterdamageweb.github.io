<p>As the job progresses and the environment is supported, products can be dried by managing the humidity, energy, and airflow (heat). Even more into the drying, air motion must be re-directed and guarantee good transfer of energy to the remaining wet locations. The total need for humidity control and airflow can be lower than at the beginning of the project because there is substantially less wetness in products being vaporized throughout the latter phase.</p>

However, failure to get rid of infected materials and to decrease wetness and humidity can present major long-lasting health risks. Standing water and damp materials are a breeding ground for bacteria, such as viruses, bacteria, and mold. They can trigger illness, trigger allergies, and continue to damage products long after the flood.</p>
