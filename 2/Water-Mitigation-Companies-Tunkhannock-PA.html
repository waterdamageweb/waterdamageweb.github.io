<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, given the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and generally have poor ventilation and little air circulation, a combination that can cause mold to grow. And naturally, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to severe weather or undetected leaks in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, as soon as mold establishes, cinder block or concrete walls can be challenging to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Among our very first tasks when we find mold in a structure is to cordon off that area to stop it from spreading out. We utilize tools like plastic sheeting and air scrubbers to find additional mold development. Our experts will make sure that the remediation process does not enable the mold to spread. We don't want spores to get away throughout the process and possibly enter into other parts of the home or building where they can grow again.</p>
