<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely harmful. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were really practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>They called me morning and asked me for assistance. I arrived to access the circumstance and discovered the water was going through the floor to the downstairs ceilings and all the drywall was ruined. To add to the problem, we had actually insulated all the floors and interior walls for sound absorption. All had to be gotten rid of and reinstalled throughout the home. We likewise set up portable heating fans to speed up the drying procedure.</p>
