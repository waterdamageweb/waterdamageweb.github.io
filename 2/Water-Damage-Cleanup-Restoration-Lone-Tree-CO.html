<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most devastating things that can take place to a family or an individual.

The type of wood floor covering you may have identifies and restricts the type of repairs that need to happen. Strong hardwood flooring enables a wider series of alternatives to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface.
