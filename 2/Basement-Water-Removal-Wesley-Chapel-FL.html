<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then clean it away with a damp towel. Similar to some of the above techniques, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
