<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were really handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
