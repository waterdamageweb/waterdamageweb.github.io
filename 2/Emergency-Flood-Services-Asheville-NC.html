<p>Utilizing bleach or other chemicals to kill indoor mold growth is not needed in many cases. The goal should be to get rid of mold development by cleaning or getting rid of moldy products. Dead mold can still position health dangers if you are exposed.

<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>
