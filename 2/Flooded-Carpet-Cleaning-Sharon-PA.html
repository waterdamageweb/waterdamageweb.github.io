<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings ought to be included in the drying record to consist of air, hvac, and equipment systems.

It is necessary to understand that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if adequate dehumidification is being used or if changes are required.</p>
