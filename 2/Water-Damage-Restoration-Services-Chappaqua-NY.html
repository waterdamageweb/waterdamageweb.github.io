<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By minimizing the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is necessary to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
