The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or approaches will be the most reliable. It is crucial to figure out if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to utilize on any loss.

The greater the number, the much faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
