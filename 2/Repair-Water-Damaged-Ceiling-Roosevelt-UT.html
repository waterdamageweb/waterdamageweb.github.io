<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
