<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly damaging. We engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado as soon as InstaScope was developed. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized expert on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was appointed to validate and evaluate the new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other technique or device, can deliver clinically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so instantly. So when you think about all the risks of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
