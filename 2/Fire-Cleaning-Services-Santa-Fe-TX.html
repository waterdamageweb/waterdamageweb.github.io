<p>Rust is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the steady and slow degeneration of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no trusted timetable for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components usually begin wearing away instantly after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How quick the rust process takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
