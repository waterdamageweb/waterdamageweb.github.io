<p>Smoke damage is a typical adverse effects of fire damage, but it can occur on its own if a fire is consisted of. After the standing water has been removed and products that could present a drying or structural danger have been removed, the drying procedure will start. This often includes putting fans and a dehumidifier in the location. In some cases, it may also include installing plastic sheeting and utilizing heating units so that the water can evaporate. If walls have actually been affected, it may be necessary to remove baseboards or drill holes so that they dry properly. A section of the carpet might also have to be lifted so that the carpet and the pad will dry. The possibility of odor and mold growth increases There's also a possibility of structural damage happening from extreme wetness if these procedures aren't performed.</p>
<p>It's true that more and more handset makers have moved towards waterproof designs in the last few years, and this trend seems to have no decrease in sight. Still, not all of us have the luxury of a waterproof phone and that suggests we need to turn to other techniques. The very best approach for preventing water damage is to take preventative measures ahead of time, using something like the CaliCase water resistant pouch for circumstances where you know you may be reaching water.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we wish to address using bleach on mold. Using bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities especially if used in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at eliminating mold than a mild cleaning agent and a moist fabric, so we advise the least toxic alternative.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
