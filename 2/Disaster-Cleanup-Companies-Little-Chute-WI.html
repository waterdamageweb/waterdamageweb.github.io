Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get damp and just starts to sag prior to drying, fixing it might simply need pressing it back into location, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
