In some cases it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible signs of wetness, dripping water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might collapse or droop under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable plaster material. Other times, you may discover little indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand gradually.</p>

You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the gadget. Sometimes cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water long.</p>
