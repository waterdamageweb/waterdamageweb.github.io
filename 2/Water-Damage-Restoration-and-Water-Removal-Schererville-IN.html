Dark, damp crawl spaces can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they flourish. The concrete structure of your home can trigger leaking in the basement if there is moisture leaking through it. Condensation in the area between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roofing, which can result in mold and decomposing. When inspecting your home for possible reasons for water damage make certain to watch out for wetness in light fixtures along with the general condition of any noticeable piping.</p>

When this is done, you may now install negative air machines to get rid of any remaining smell of the mold cleaner and the mold itself.</p>
