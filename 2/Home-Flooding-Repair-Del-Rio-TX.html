<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is wet and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
