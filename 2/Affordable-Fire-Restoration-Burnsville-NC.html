<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his men were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were really helpful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings should be consisted of in the drying record to consist of devices, air, and heating and cooling systems. Wetness content levels for wet structural products need to be recorded in a wetness material spreadsheet to reveal the progress of drying These tape-recorded moisture material readings will show that the structure is back to an appropriate variety of pre-loss condition. It is important to understand that air records alone will not show that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if sufficient dehumidification is being utilized or if changes are needed.</p>
