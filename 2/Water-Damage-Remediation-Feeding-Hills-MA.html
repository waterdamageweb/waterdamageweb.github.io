<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is great and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
