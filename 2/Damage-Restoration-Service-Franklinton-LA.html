<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag before drying, repairing it may just require pushing it back into location, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
