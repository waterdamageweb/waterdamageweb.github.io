<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As mentioned, rapid air movement throughout wet surface areas of assemblies or products is a critical element of successfully and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Rapid air movement across the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface moisture gives way to lowering moisture material in low evaporation products. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
