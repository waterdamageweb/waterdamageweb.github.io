<p>BRAVO - task well done! Found a flood in the house in San Francisco - water had been over flowing a 2nd floor sink for 15 hours. Called Allied, signed work order on line and workers were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of equipment to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were put on hardwood floors, walls and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Excellent, expert care. Really pleased with their quick shipment of emergency service AND their attention to information to make sure the water damage was dried completely.</p>
