<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
