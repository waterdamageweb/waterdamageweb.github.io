<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible signs of moisture, dripping water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or collapse under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous gypsum product. Other times, you might discover small signs like coffee-colored discolorations that might expand over time.</p>
<p>The most essential element of treating drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew.

Standard family fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air required to dry a space sufficiently.</p>
