<h3>Flood Restoration Company in Marblehead Massachusetts</h2>
<p>We recently had major water damage due to a washing device overflow. Rainbow came out to your house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action required to prevent more damage burning the midnight oil into the night. They likewise finished the whole dry which took several days and a lot of effort. Always arrived on time and did what they promised and kept me informed of each step. It was a pleasure to deal with the entire team. I would not think twice to recommend them for any work of this nature including mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a serious health risk, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout several days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
