<p>Jake (and his team) are incredible to deal with. They were quick to respond initially and offered a fair and sensible  quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule immediately and get the work done really rapidly. Our mold problem ended up being smaller than first believed so the last invoice showed the real work required and was less than very first quoted. Jake was very responsive to calls and e-mails answering questions throughout the process. All in all, I had a great experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
