<p>Jake (and his team) are incredible to deal with. They were quick to respond initially and offered a fair and sensible  quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule immediately and get the work done really rapidly.

Jake was very responsive to calls and e-mails answering questions throughout the process. All in all, I had a great experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
