<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

Ceiling drywall panels may droop or collapse under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous plaster product. Other times, you may observe small signs like coffee-colored stains that may expand gradually.</p>
<p>The most essential element of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew.
