<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can occur by itself if a fire is included. Several hundred suits filed in the last 5 years declare that most of these houses contain dozens of violations of the state-mandated building code that ultimately permitted water to drain pipes into both brand-new and remodelled houses. Lots of homes with water damage lack standard weatherproofing products, inspection reports say. Coats of stucco are often too thin. According to a suit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, craftsmanship was so bad that, even before the family moved in, a mushroom grew in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bedroom.</p>
<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
