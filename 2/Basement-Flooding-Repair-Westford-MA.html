<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for visible mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach also emits extreme fumes and it even produces hazardous gas when blended with ammonia. There are safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which don't produce harmful fumes or leave hazardous residue. For these reasons attempt to avoid utilizing bleach and if you need to utilize it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
