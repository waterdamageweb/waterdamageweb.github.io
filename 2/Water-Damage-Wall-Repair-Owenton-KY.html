<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore protection, and cover legs, arms and hands to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of noticeable mold. If the musty location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will decrease the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use industrial black mold removal products, which can be found in a lot of hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the musty locations, in addition to any nearby areas. If you utilize bleach, make certain it will not tarnish the product or surface. Place all sponges, devices and other products used in cleaning in a heavy duty trash can, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a close-by exit rather than the primary house, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
