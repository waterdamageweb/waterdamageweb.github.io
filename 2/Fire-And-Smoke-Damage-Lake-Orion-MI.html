<p>Since common structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
