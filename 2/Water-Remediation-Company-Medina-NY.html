<p>Crawl areas typically grow mold for the same factors as basements do-they tend to stay wet long-term. They're smaller sized than basements, however, and normally have more ventilation, so they don't tend to have as large a mold development location, making typical expenses better to $500 for remediation. Because of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this area is usually less intense, so getting rid of and cleaning affected locations is often sufficient.</p>

<p>After eliminating the damaged drywall, measure the size of the hole so you can cut out a spot from a new sheet of drywall. Place four drywall clips around the hole. Protect each one in place with a drywall screw, making certain to countersink the screw head. Be careful not to overdrive the screw. Eliminate the spot and insert it, then secure it to the drywall clips (and readily available ceiling joists) utilizing drywall screws. Take care not to over-tighten.<p>
<p>To kill mold: Use white distilled vinegar and pour it into a spray bottle without watering it down. Spray the vinegar onto the moldy surface and leave it to sit for an hour. Finally, clean the area clean with water and permit the surface area to dry. Any odor from the vinegar need to clear within a few hours.
