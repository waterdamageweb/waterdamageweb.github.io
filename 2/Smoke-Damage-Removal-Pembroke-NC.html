<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our soaked crawlspace right away.

When this flammable fuel - drywall, furniture, or carpet - has been heated up to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and volatile gases will be launched in the kind of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger long lasting damage and should be handled by skilled professionals, heat is the most obvious, and destructive, item of this chemical reaction.
