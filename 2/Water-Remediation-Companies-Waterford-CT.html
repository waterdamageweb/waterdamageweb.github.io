Search for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, velvety, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper).

<p>Water damage can be the beginning point for numerous major problems that can affect a structure, damage personal property and present severe health dangers to residents.

Water damaged structures can be the ideal breeding place for mold, while bad indoor ventilation can trigger molds to grow. Wet structure products and humid indoor air are mold's best friends.</p>
