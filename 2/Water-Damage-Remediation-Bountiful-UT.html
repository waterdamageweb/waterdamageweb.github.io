<p>When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. It can be an irreversible health danger and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, duct and electrical wiring.</p>
