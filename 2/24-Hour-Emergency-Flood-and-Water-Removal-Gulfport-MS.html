<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any circumstance, particularly when the hot water heater system lies inside the home.

The perpetrator might have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surfaces starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any hard surface areas to remove the mold from the surface area. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are removed, normally involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
