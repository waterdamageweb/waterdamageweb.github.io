<h3>Water & Fire Damage Repair‎ in Summerville</h3>
<p>Before you clean your home, you need to wear proper security. Smoke, soot and particles can be dangerous to inhale, so wear a respirator if there is substantial soot in the damaged location. Use long pants and sleeves to secure your skin. You must also use gloves and eye security. Given that you will be freeing soot as you clean, it's important to set floor security and remove any furnishings or family items that are not damaged. If the damaged location is little, you can probably get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets. But if you're cleaning a whole room, it's a good idea to get rid of those clean products and even seal off other rooms that are undamaged. Bear in mind the shoes you're wearing so you don't track soot stains into other spaces.<p>
