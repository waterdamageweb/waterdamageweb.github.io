Phillip was expert, friendly and helped me comprehend the procedure of what would be taking place to repair and repair our home. Because of their professionalism and attention to information, I could inform each and every employee I met was picked. The completed item was beyond our expectations.

<p>Jake (and his group) are amazing to work with. They were quick to react at first and supplied a sensible and fair quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule without delay and get the work done really quickly. Our mold problem wound up being smaller sized than first believed so the final billing showed the real work required and was less than first quoted. Jake was very responsive to emails and calls addressing questions throughout the process. All in all, I had a great experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
