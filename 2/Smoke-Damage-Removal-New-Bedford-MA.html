Underneath seemingly unblemished exteriors made from different products-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged everything from window sills to insulation that when puffed like pink fairy floss. In many cases, wood sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes quickly, falling apart into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have plagued some walls.</p>
<p>Through both rain and snow throughout the year, Seattle homeowners have seen their fair share of the almost 40 inches anticipated every year. With what feels like rain every day here in the city, it is not challenging to satisfy the saturation conditions of the ground to facilitate hazardous conditions like mudslides, flash flooding, and other emergencies.
