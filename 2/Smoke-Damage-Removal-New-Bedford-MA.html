Underneath seemingly unblemished exteriors made from different products-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged everything from window sills to insulation that when puffed like pink fairy floss. In many cases, wood sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes quickly, falling apart into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have plagued some walls.</p>
