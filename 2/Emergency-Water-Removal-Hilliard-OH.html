<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. Juice 3 to five lemons and put over afflicted location.

As with some of the above techniques, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
