<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
