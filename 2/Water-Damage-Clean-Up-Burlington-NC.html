<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone.

<p>Unfortunately, however, using bleach is only effective if the mold is growing on non-porous materials such as tiles, bath tubs, glass and counter tops.

But if you're cleaning an entire room, it's a good idea to remove those clean items and even seal other spaces that are undamaged. Be mindful of the shoes you're using so you do not track soot stains into other rooms.<p>
