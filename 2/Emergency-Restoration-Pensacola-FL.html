<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally harmful. Some homeowners choose to repair smoke damage by themselves rather of hiring an expert.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
