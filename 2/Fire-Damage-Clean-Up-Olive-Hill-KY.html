Craig Hawkins and his team at Enviroshield have more than twenty years of experience in water damage and mold remediation. They're certified, use a nationally recognized procedure and supply a 25-year guarantee on all work.

<p>Just remember that this is likely to invalidate any warranty coverage you've got, and there's a danger that your Do It Yourself work will cause damage instead of repair it. If you can currently see it, you generally do NOT need to spend money on pre-testing mold Plain and simple: you just need to eliminate it. Because no visible mold development belongs in a healthy home (no matter what the type) and all mold need to be eliminated the exact same method, there is normally no requirement to recognize what types and concentrations of mold you have via testing.<p>

We can help bring back the environment in your home and offer irreversible treatments that keep mold growth at bay. Set an old box fan or a cheap brand-new one in a window to ventilate the space while working. Throw it out when you're done cleaning, because the spores are nearly difficult to clean off. Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>
