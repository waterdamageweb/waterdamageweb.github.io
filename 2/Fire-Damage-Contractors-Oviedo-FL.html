<p>Due to the fact that typical building products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season.
