<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach also produces severe fumes and it even produces poisonous gas when blended with ammonia. There are safer options such as borax or vinegar which don't produce unsafe fumes or leave toxic residue. For these reasons attempt to avoid using bleach and if you must utilize it, only use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
