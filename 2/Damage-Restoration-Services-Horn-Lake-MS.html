<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
