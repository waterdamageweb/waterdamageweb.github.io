<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
