The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
