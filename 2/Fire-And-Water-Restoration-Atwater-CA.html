<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to monitor and change the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and also were very helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
