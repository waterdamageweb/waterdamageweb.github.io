Examples of Classification 3 water can include, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap despite visible material or color; all forms of flooding from seawater; ground surface area water and rising water from rivers or streams; and other polluted water going into or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from typhoons, hurricanes, or other weather associated occasions.
