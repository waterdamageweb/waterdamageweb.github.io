<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or techniques will be the most effective. It is necessary to determine if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and practical energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and provide the very best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the quicker products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
