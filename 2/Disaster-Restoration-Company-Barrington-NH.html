<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying because the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
