<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely destructive. Jake and his guys were amazing in assisting us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and likewise were extremely valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster.

Determining the dew point is necessary in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas kind. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid kind. The higher the dew point increases, the higher the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>BRAVO - job well done! Found a flood in the house in San Francisco - water had been over streaming a second floor sink for 15 hours.

Drying fans were set up, heating pads were put on hardwood ceilings, floors and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Outstanding, expert care.
