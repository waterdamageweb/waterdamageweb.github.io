Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very polite and easy-going person.</p>
