The nasty odor resembles the fragrance of damp, mildewy laundry. Regrettably, it's not unusual for property owners to mistake mold development for dirt.</p>
<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
