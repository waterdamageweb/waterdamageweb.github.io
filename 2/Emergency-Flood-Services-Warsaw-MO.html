<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to maintain the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year.

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout numerous days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
