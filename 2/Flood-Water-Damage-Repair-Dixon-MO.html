<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it might look cottony, velvety, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for signs of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Because the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water, getting it wet can turn into a significant headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to droop prior to drying out, fixing it might just require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
